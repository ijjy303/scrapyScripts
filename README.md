## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">30 "Idiots" Who Were Right the Whole Time</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Galileo - he believed the Earth and other planets orbited the Sun, contrary to popular belief that all stars and planets orbited Earth. The Catholic Church called it heresy, and ordered him to turn himself in to the Holy Office to begin a trial for his beliefs.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165582.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Sinead O’Connor - she was vilified for ripping up a photo of the pope to protest child abuse within the Catholic Church. Spoiler alert - the Catholic Church was covering up child abuse.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165564.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Stanislav Petrov. Though we dont see him as crazy, Im sure his crewmates thought he was. He directly disobeyed Soviet military protocols and prevented a nuclear war.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165565.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Rose McGowan was completely ostracized and blacklisted for talking about Weinstein too early.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165566.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. John Yudkin. The single scientist who didnt believe the sugar industrys research that demonized fats. Till his death hes adamant that fats werent the cause of obesity and heart attacks.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165567.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. During the plague in Moscow there was a priest (or something) DIScouraging people kissing the statue of Maria, as to stop the spreading of the virus.

The poor man was burned alive for blasphemy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165568.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Tesla. Edison is still credited with the lightbulb. His last words put it into perspective All these years that I had spent in the service of mankind brought me nothing but insults and humiliation</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165569.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Hemingway talked about the FBI following him prior to his suicide. They thought he was paranoid. Decades later some papers get released, turns out the FBI was following him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165570.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Lisa Bonet. She was vilified for hating Cosby in the 80s. Who’s the villain now?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165571.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. The inventor of dialysis, Dr. Willem Kolff. Although its hard to blame them, haha. He saw people dying of kidney disease and said Hey, what if we take all of the blood out of your body, clean it, and put it back in? (Cleaning your blood is the job of your kidneys, and a dialysis machine is basically an artificial kidney, on the *outside* of your body.) It was a wild idea and he started his work during WWII and had to work with basic materials like orange juice cans, sausage skins, and a washing machine. Many of the first patients died, but they were already going to die painfully. Eventually, he ironed the kinks out and started saving lives.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165572.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Charles Darwin. The religious outcry against evolution was engineered by his academic rivals more than from religious resistance. But even now, after all that politics is centuries dead, there remain people who categorically resist demonstrable fact because of it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165573.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Craig Ferguson having empathy for Britney Spears in his 2007 monologue.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165574.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. There was a wacko looking guy on Oprah who stopped his vanilla presentation to tell the audience that plastic causes cancer, stop using it to store food and water.

Oprah cut to commercial and whisked him off the show.

Dude was right. BPAs were outed that day, but it took another decade for that info to become public knowledge.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165575.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Anyone who covered their webcam camera.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165576.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Giordano Bruno was (probably) the first European who proposed the possibility that not only was the universe infinite, but stars were not just points of light in the sky; they could be suns with their own planets, and that some of those planets might even host life.

The Catholic Church had him tried for Heresy and had him burned at the stake and his contemporaries though he was completely insane. He had some kooky ideas, but he was absolutely right about the size of the universe and stars being suns with their own planets.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165577.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Margaret Dunbar. Her four year old son went missing and one day the cops found him and brought him home. Except it wasn’t her son and everyone tried to gaslight her into believing it was. Well she was right and no one knows what happened to the real Bobby Dunbar to this day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165578.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I dont know that guys name but he basically from 1541-1542 travelled accross south america. The first european to do so. While he was on his journey he said he saw millions of people and large cities , with a lot of life in them , where today is the amazon rainforest.After he had finished his journey he had told the stories of those cities and about a hundred years later when explorers visited the place there was nothing , no cities , no people , just jungle. So they thought he had made all that up. But modern technology has shown that there might have accually been a lot of cities there , and that those people died out with smallpox and all cities were covered by the jungle within the course of 50 years. So basically people thought he was crazy and made everything up but in modern times its proven that he was right all along.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165579.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Will Rogers a humorist when he invented the term trickle-down economics as a joke stating that this type of economy would just make the rich richer and the poor poorer.

And then we actually implemented it and used the term trickle-down. And Will Rogers was right.

The rent has gone though the roof and our salaries have stagnated and we cant afford The American Dream anymore.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165580.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Martha Mitchell.. She was like part of the reason why it was discovered that Nixon was involved in Watergate. Her husband was part of the Nixon group so she got some inside details. When she wanted to tell the news about the whole scandal, her husband and Nixon men put her in a hotel and restrained her from having any contact with anyone. She was seen as an insane person her husband and Nixons men even managed to convince the psychiatrists that she was out of her mind.

Actually theres a phenomenon in psychology which was named after her a.k.a the Martha Mitchell Effect</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165581.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Heinrich Schliemann. He 100% believed that ancient Troy had really existed. So he armed himself with a copy of the Iliad, and actually managed to find and excavate the city. Hed told everyone and their sister that Troy was a real place for 40 years before he found it, and everyone thought he was cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Not so much, it turns out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165583.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Remember the government accountant in George W Bush’s presidency who said the war in Afghanistan would cost a billion dollars a month and he was fired? Well, he was right. It was 300 million dollars per day for 20 years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165584.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Dr. Atkins.

When his first book The New Diet Revolution came out, he was mocked and ridiculed for thinking that refined sugars, flour, and starch caused the glycemic index to skyrocket which led to your body storing fat. When he died people thought he died from his own diet.

Keto-acidosis and how you can lose weight by reducing your glycemic index was largely his research.

It was later stolen and copied and called The Zone Diet and The Caveman Diet and The Paleo Diet which were all based on his work.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165585.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. All the people that said the NSA/CIA was spying on us for years.
Thanks to edward Snowden we now know that was true and it was so much so that the NSA had built back doors in pretty much every single electronic device that exsists all the way down to the network switch level on cisco switches and the internet backbone through AT&T network hubs. The fact that there wasnt mass revolt after that information was released kinda blew my mind.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165586.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Eisenhower. Re: The military–industrial complex.

In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165587.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Clair Patterson-he was made out to be crazy by giant oil companies bc he tested ice cores in the Arctic and figured out that the amount of lead in the atmosphere, the water, and our bodies was extremely high and caused by leaded gasoline. He petitioned Congress for years to make it illegal to add lead to gasoline, but the corporations kept getting him shut down because they used lead as an anti-knock agent for internal combustion engines. Ironically, lead was causing everyone else to go crazy because it is shaped like a neurotransmitter and blocks receptors causing insanity, similarly to what mercury does, and many employees of the oil companies had gone mad. After decades of battling the oil companies, he finally got his way and lead was removed from gasoline. Since then, the amount of lead in the atmosphere and I’m living things has decreased dramatically. Clair Patterson… a f**king hero.

He also created the first truly “clean room.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165588.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Boltzman spend his life trying to prove his formula but ended up commiting suicide because none of his collegues believed him. Now, his formula is basically the amen in thermodynamics.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165589.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. MrBeast infiltrated the YouTube market early. Mastered it. Making millions on millions a decade later at age 23. He bet on new media, looked crazy for a while but in the end won big.

I understand to most he’s not a historical figure but as a marketing and digital media expert—he’s a pioneer in my book. He wrote the playbook. Plus there’s a typo in the question haha.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165590.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Lord Kitchener (Horacio Herbert Kitchener) Secretary State of War for the British Army. At the onset of WW1, everyone thought the war would end very quickly, either going one way or the other. Kitchener was one of the few people to envision a long war, and to prepare accordingly, even though the British government actively hampered many of his efforts (even though he was a war hero)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165591.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Mitt Romney and his comment about Russia. I voted against him, but I’ll be damned if he wasn’t right about Russia.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165592.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. Henry A Wallace was Roosevelts running mate and vice president in his 3rd term in office but was dropped from the ticket in the 4th in favor of Truman. Wallace was correct on a lot of issues manifesting in America that are still here today, race, education, and what happens to society unfer unregulated capitalism.

In many ways Wallaces story mirrors the story of every single progressive the democratic party has tried to run in the 20th century. Rhetoric is fine but dont go after corporate greed.

Truman and Wallace could not have been more different. If Wallace had stayed as running mate and vp at the time of FDRs death, its possible to imagine we would be living in a totally different world.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165593.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Higher resolution cameras allow us to observe a much higher image density than ever before. As opposed to the Hubble telescope, the James Webb Telescope images capture a lower range of light frequency -- hence the stark difference in the types of colors and light waves shown.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/11/113607/87165043/james-webb-photos-12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3.

## <a href="#linky4" id="linky3">12 Life Tips Everyone Should Know</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. In most cases, it will cost your employer far more to replace you than it would to give you a raise. So ask firmly.
The cost of recruiting, onboarding/training, etc often exceeds the cost of paying an already established employee more. Just remember that next time you talk yourself out of asking for a raise.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164630.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. If you have an Android phone, go to the developer options and set Animation Time to x0.5! Your phone will feel like it’s gotten a huge processor update.
Unlock Developer Options:

Settings > About Phone > 7x tap on Build Number

Decrease animation time:

Settings > System > Developer Options > Set all Options with Animation Scale to x0.5 or less</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164629.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Your parents took decades to furnish their house.
If you’re just starting out, remember that it took your parents decades to collect all the furniture, decorations, appliances, etc you are used to having around. It’s easy to forget this because you started remembering things a long while after they started out together, so it feels like that’s how a house should always be.

It’s impossible for most people starting out to get to that level of settled in without burying themselves in debt. So relax, take your time, and embrace the emptiness! You’ll enjoy the house much more if you’re not worried about how to pay for everything all the time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164631.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. You will get calls about your taxes, there is a 100% chance they are scams.
I just received a voicemail today that said there was a “tax fraud pending against me” and that I should call back immediately before “I get arrested”. Please be cautious as these are scams. If you ever have questions regarding your taxes, go to the place you filed them and start there, then go to the IRS directly. The IRS never calls, you’ll get letters.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164632.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If you ever forget your WiFi password or you want to get your school WiFi password etc. Just type this command into the command line of a computer already connected to that WiFi: netsh wlan show profile WiFi-name key=clear.
Also when youre at a hotel that charges for wifi (or for faster wifi), get the password from the business center computer which is probably connected to the employee wifi</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164633.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. If you think someone has forgotten your name, skip the awkwardness and mention it in third person.
Last night someone I’ve volunteered with on-and-off for 2 years, I’m pretty sure forgot my name, so I worked into conversation said something like “I have a tendency to leave things till the last minute, and my roommate is like ‘Alybank! Why are you like this?” I could see the relief on the other persons face when I said it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164634.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Inflation is currently ~2% per year. If you are not getting more than that per year as a raise, you are getting a pay cut. Make sure to take inflation into account when you get a raise.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164635.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Those viral posts asking things like “Your stripper name is your first pet and your mother’s maiden name” are amazingly effective ways to reveal answers to common security questions you may be using elsewhere.
The next time you see a mass post or “share this on” message asking for information like this, remember you’re sharing important personal information which may be dangerous to share openly with others. There’s a good reason why so many of them rely on your funny answer being made up of your mother’s maiden name, first pet, favourite teacher or street you grew up on…Always be careful where you’re sharing information, consider whether it’s really necessary to share it, or consider using incorrect answers – either to the post, or to the security questions themselves (as long as you can remember what you set them to).</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164628.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. If you’re someone that always listens to music in your car make it a habit at least once a month to turn it off and listen to your car for a couple minutes. There may be an issue you’re not aware of which could be caught before it turns into a major problem</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164636.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Be skeptical of products that say “Clinically proven”. That is a marketing term and only says they’ve done their own private study that is designed to show the result the company wants. It is not the same as a “Scientifically proven” study which is published and open for peer review.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164637.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. if you need somewhere to work/relax with friendly staff, nice AC, plenty of seating, free WiFi, and available all across the US, you’re in luck! There are more public libraries in the US than there are Starbucks or McDonalds! And you’re under no obligation to buy anything to sit there.
16,568 – Public Libraries in the US. There are over 116,000 if you include academic, school, military, government, corporate, etc

14,606 – Starbucks stores in the U.S. in 2018

## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">25 Trashiest Wedding Stories Ever Told</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. At a park. Pick-up trucks with Igloo coolers opened on the tailgate were the bar. Everything was served in red solo cups BEFORE the wedding. Everyone got drunk. The bride walked down the aisle drinking from a red solo cup instead of holding a bouquet. It was essentially a tailgate party with a preacher invited. -u/Butterbean-queen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163749.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Groom beat the sh*t out of the father-in-law. Father in law went to bathroom and died. Groom shot himself in the parking lot. This was 25 years ago in Chicago. Crazy wedding. -u/pohuja</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163750.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The bride and her sisters did a strip tease/lap dance on the groom immediately following dinner. In front of his grandmother. -u/JohnaldL</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163751.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Surely that video of the bride walking down the backyard aisle while dirty dancing to her own sh*tty recorded cover of Crazy Bitch has got to be up around here somewhere.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. My own. In a Mississippi judges office with a bag of Cheetos on her desk. She wiped her hands on a napkin, grabbed a bible, and did her thing with orange crumbs on her lips. Her work heels were not on because she was in her office. It was extremely rushed. I understand that she was on her break but we didnt mind waiting. -u/Zezima-RS</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163757.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Probably my dads 2nd marriage. Along the banks of a river with trailer homes in the background. Hes wearing a tuxedo T-shirt and rainbow mirror sunglasses. The ceremony took place at noon: hed been drinking since 5am. I had to walk one of the bridesmaids down a flight of steps as she was legally blind, and someone asked me if I was going to bang her. Sighs. -u/shibbster</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163758.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Camo print wedding dress that was borderline see-through. Walked down the aisle to the Scooby-Doo theme. No, nobody knows why they chose that song, including the couple themselves. They divorced a few months later after they both stopped cleaning the house in an act of defiance against one another. -u/Much_Difference</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163759.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. A wedding on the beach behind Hooters. The officiant stood next to a trash bin. As if it was planned, the trash collector pulled up during the vows. Did he wait to change the bag? Absolutely not. Children at the wedding swarmed the couple like flies around the trash can just after the kiss, stepping all over her dress. She bent over to adjust her sandal and a pack of Marlboro reds fell out of the bust along with her right breast. It felt like we were rubbernecking instead of witnessing a marriage. -u/Svetlana_of_Athens</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163760.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. I don’t even know where to begin...Ceremony was comprised of immediate family then followed by a reception with all guests in a relatively nice hotel banquet hall. An hour in at 7pm the open bar was completely closed down because MULTIPLE guests were throwing up in the bathroom sinks causing flooding.

<span style="font-size:4em">
The groom was so wasted even before the ceremony but was blackout by the time of the reception. During the first dance, he kept his hands in his cargo pant khakis the entire time and ate dinner sitting on the floor in a corner of the hall while the bride sat at the head table alone. About two hours in, the groom randomly left and slept at their house while the bride stayed in the newlywed suite by herself. They are now separated as you may have assumed by this point. -u/Rdab3</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163763.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Waitress at a bogan wedding. The night ended with the chef and I rounding up the kids and barricading us all in the kitchen and locking the doors to prevent the melee of fighting adults outside from A) accessing MORE weapons (Some of them BYO’d knives) and B) hurting the kids. They ranged in age from toddlers to preteens. It was just the chef and me, 2 women and a whole bunch of screaming and frightened kids until the police came and carted everyone off to jail.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Wedding photographer showed up the next morning for the scheduled photoshoot. I had to tell him he could find the wedding party at the local jail. The chef and I are still friends, but we both quit that place shortly after that epic wedding. -u/a_nonny_mooze</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163766.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I was actually the bartender but it was a hoot. The wedding was outside and it stormed violently. Groom was hammered pre-wedding. Hit on all the bartenders. Then the DJ got hammered, made lewd comments to women on the microphone. Then basically everyone was hammered, knocked over the wedding cake which also happened to be a table with many candles, so the place caught on fire. Good times. Often wonder how that marriage worked out. -u/SnooHobbies7109</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163767.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. The bride made a speech thanking her in-laws for financial assistance for the event. Her mother was not thanked and she was furious. There was a long head table for the bridal party and parents. It was made out of small tables pushed together covered by one long tablecloth. The mother pulled a small table out of the arrangement, catching the table cloth, and nearly destroying the head table set up.
</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163768.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
Now the bride got angry and there was much back and forth with various family members attempting to make peace. The mother refused to push back her table and began to invite others to sit with her, all people who were not meant to be seated at the front. The mother of the bride continued to sit there and talk sh*t about her daughter, the bride, to anyone who would listen. -u/lilyspads</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163770.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Wedding was in a suburban driveway. The maid of honor stole the bouquet from someone’s garden and the best man proudly announced he had shoplifted the rings. The groom wore a button-down shirt that said ‘f*ck off’ in fancy lettering. The bride stopped in the middle of the vows to tell her mother to ‘get that f*cking kid out of here.’ It was her second kid by the previous bloke. -u/HopelessEmu</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163771.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. There were no tables and chairs. Like none. They had an open bar but no f*cking chairs. Everyone had to put their drink on the ground and hold their plate to eat. It was f*cking crazy. Everyone just assumed that some sort of terrible thing happened where the tables and chair people didnt bring them but afterward I asked her (the bride) what happened and she just said: Oh we would have had to pay extra for that. -u/PM_MEE_PUSSY_PICS</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87163772.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I had one of my friends from high school get married in a trashy way. His fiancé at the time invited him to lunch at Buffalo Wild Wings. She had also invited the whole family (they were in on it), and once my friend showed up he found out it was a surprises wedding (just like you would do a surprise birthday party.)

## <a href="#linky8" id="linky7">28 WTF Moments in History We Don't Talk About</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. In the 1970s, a film team was filming an episode of The Six Million Dollar Man at an amusement park fun house. A stage hand was moving a fake wax figure on a rope when one arm fell off, revealing human flesh and bone underneath. Following an autopsy, it was discovered to be the body of a 60-year-old outlaw who had been taxidermied to some extent.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164860.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. The Filipino Zoo Girl, which was on display in the Coney Island Zoo in 1914, is one that stands out to me. People threw peanuts at her while she was restrained by ropes. Its sad to witness anything like that, especially when it involves a child so young. Many people are unaware that [human zoos] occurred, but they are a horrible chapter in human history. Whats amazing is that some have survived into the twenty-first century, but not as cruelly as they once were.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164850.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The Childrens Blizzard. It occurred in January 1888 on an unseasonably warm day. The weather was nice and many school-kids were tricked into not wearing coats or jackets to school, some only in short sleeves. While the kids were in class, the weather outside changed dramatically from warm and sunny at noon to dark and heavy like a thunderstorm, with heavy winds and visibility at 3 steps by 3 pm. Children left school to go home and do their chores (this was in Minnesota) and were expected to milk the cows and do whatever else was involved in the family farm. But they got lost in the darkness and snow and the wind and many froze to death in their town, just yards from houses or other sources of refuge. 235 people, mostly children died.There is a novel about the blizzard out now, and there is a nonfiction book about the event as well. I think they have the same title, different authors:The Childrens Blizzard (Nonfiction by David Laskin)The Childrens Blizzard (Fiction by Melanie Benjamin)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164851.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Jellyboys.During the 1800s British noblemen in India would use so called jellyboys (local boys smeared in jam) to walk beside them attracting all the bugs, flies and mosquitoes, creating a neat golfing experience for the nobility and a not so neat experience for the boys.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164852.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Magdalene asylums, also known as Magdalene laundries. Places of reform for women that didnt fit the idea of a good upstanding citizen. The most well known ones were in Ireland. The women and girls were abused and mistreated by asylum staff, most of whom were nuns.Mass graves, selling these womens children to people in other countries, blocking any parental rights... Theres apparently at least one movie coming out, a lot of stories about it, and so many people sharing stories from their mothers and grandmothers. I guess its more well known than I first thought.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164853.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The Radium Girls. In the 1920s, they worked at a watch company painting the hours on the watches using radium, a radioactive element that glows in the dark. They did this with no PPE and werent told radium is dangerous. Meanwhile, the chemists had full PPE and worked in a sealed environment.Worse, they were instructed to lick the tip of the brush to make a very fine point. Some of them would paint their nails or their teeth with it for fun when they went out at night.They would develop cancer whenever the paint touched, and many of them had such decay in their jaws that their mandibles had to be held on with bandages.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164854.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. In my familys region in Africa they used to carry out the capital punishment by snakebite.Just a snakebite to each ankle, and then letting the man spend his remaining time with his family before he [passed away] (under supervision).I thought it sounded sort of humane in a way, like our lethal injections, but apparently they say it was one of the most horrific ways that existed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164855.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. The Vipeholm Experiment.Sweden are mostly known as a not very scary country. With good and mostly accessible dental care.The Vipeholm experiments were a series of human experiments where patients of Vipeholm Hospital for the intellectually disabled in Lund, Sweden, were fed large amounts of sweets to provoke dental caries (1945–1955). The experiments were sponsored both by the sugar industry and the dentist community, in an effort to determine whether carbohydrates affected the formation of cavities.The experiments provided extensive knowledge about dental health and resulted in enough empirical data to link the intake of sugar to dental caries.[1] However, today they are considered to have violated the principles of medical ethics.Hey, you are institutionalized and suffering and powerless - lets make your teeth rot out of your skull. For uhhh science.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164856.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. The sad case of Ota Benga. He was a “pygmy” boy from the Congo who was essentially captured and brought to the USA to be displayed in freak shows. He had undergone tribal customs such as having his teeth filed into points before his capture.He eventually got out of the carnivals and dreamed of returning to Africa, then WWI happened, making the trip impossible for the foreseeable future. He [ended himself] by gunshot.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164857.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Khuk Khi Kai, or the Chicken Poop Prison in Thailand. Used by French forces to hold political prisoners (rebellious Thai people) in the Chanthaburi region.The long-standing impacts of this much-feared torture are still felt in the region today - theres a Thai saying for those who buck authority that roughly translates to Be careful not to get caught in a chicken poop prison. I learned about this prison from my parents who learned about it from theirs.How it worked, was there was a small, 2-story prison. Bottom floor houses the prisoners, and the top floor is basically a huge chicken coop.The grated floor/ceiling ensures that the chicken poop falls onto the prisoners below.Apparently, even though the maximum sentence in Khuk Khi Kai was around a week, it was one of the most feared punishments there was.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164858.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. The Ideal Maternity Home here in Canada. From the 1920s till the 1940s, they took in babies from unwed mothers and they were selling them especially to desperate jewish families in New Jersey (adoption was illegal in the US back then).It was later discovered that the people who ran this business would starve the unmarketable babies by feeding them only molasses and water (the babies would last around 2 weeks on this diet). They put the corpses in wooden box often used for butter and thats why the victims are called the Butterbox Babies. The boxes were either buried on the property or at sea or burned in the home furnace. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164859.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> The parents who gave their child to this maternity home would go back and see how their child is doing but were told the child has died when in fact it had been sold to adopting parents. Between 400 and 600 died in that home and at least a thousand were adopted but sadly, the adopted babies often suffered from diseases because of the unsanitary conditions and lack of care at the home.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164861.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. The massacre of kalavrita. It is a village is Greece. The Germans entered it and rounded up all the male villagers in a field. They then shot them all with machine guns. After that they got the children and women and put them in the church. When everyone was inside, they locked the doors and set fire to the church. Around 20 minutes into the burning, a German soldier couldn’t take it anymore and opened the doors. Around half of the people escaped the fire but the rest perished. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164862.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> The German soldier was shot for this, and if you go to kalavrita today his name is on the memorial. No one was punished for this apart from the leader of the division, who I was told by my grandmother that he died in a gulag. But everyone else got away with it. It is sad that no one knows about this, as things like this happened all over Greece and Russia and Poland. I only know about this because my Great grandmother was one who escaped in the church. This massacre was in retaliation for the villagers supporting the local resistance force, which had recently [unalived] about 10 nazis.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164863.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. The January 1945 sinking of the MV Wilhelm Gustloff. It was a German ship carrying fleeing Germans from the Eastern Front to the West through the Baltic Sea. It was sunk by the Soviet Navy shorty after setting sail. The total death toll is unknown but estimated at over 9000 since there were so many stowaways. It is the worst maritime disaster ever, several times more than the Titanic.It didnt get nearly the press because they were the enemy so who cares, and the Nazi media certainly didnt report it because theyre at the waning days of a war theyre badly losing so the last thing they need is more hits to their already sinking morale.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164849.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. The Cadaver Synod.Basically the pope had a previous Popes corpse exhumed so the corpse could stand trial for something made up. So they dug up his bloated 7 month old corpse and convicted him, retroactively nullifying his papacy. Then they dumped his bloated and convicted corpse in a river. The people got pissed and overthrew the pope, who was strangled in prison. The next pope came along and had the corpse collected from the river and its papacy posthumously reinstated.897 was a crazy year.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164864.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Human “experimentation” by Japanese Unit 731 during WWII, committed primarily against innocent Chinese civilians. Nothing I’ve ever heard of in my life, including in fiction, is darker than the horrors committed for years by Unit 731, a military biological and chemical weapons research division of the Japanese Imperial military.There’s not enough room in a Reddit post to list half of it, but here’s a taste: Dissections of living babies, pregnant women, etc. without anesthesia (also known as a vivisection) usually after they had been deliberately exposed and left to suffer from horrible diseases, chemical and biological weapons, and so on. Freezing limbs off of victims. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164865.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">Horror-movie sadistic surgeries involving cutting off limbs and attaching them to the wrong sides of a victim, or removing organs and connecting the tubes back together without the organs to see what would happen, such as running the esophagus straight to the intestines with no stomach in between.Not to mention the fact that the victims were routinely tortured for the sake of torture, without even the flimsy excuse of “science” being conducted.And we’re talking about thousands upon thousands of victims, usually hapless Chinese civilians, political prisoners, POWs, and the homeless, over the course of years in huge facilities with thousands of staff committing these atrocities.The icing on the cake? General MacArthur and the rest of the US government found out about it when they captured Japan — and they granted Unit 731 immunity for their war crimes so long as they share their findings with America and ONLY America. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164866.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">Many of the former Unit 731 members even went on to have very successful and profitable futures in Japan after the war.Edit: Based on a couple of the comments I’ve gotten where people are making judgement calls about the modern day Japanese for this - I’d just like to make clear that I hold no prejudice against the Japanese, and I’m certainly not encouraging others to — every country and people has truly horrific pasts, and almost all of them sweep it under the rug as best they can. Even in our generation. We can argue that torture conducted by US soldiers in Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib, for example, aren’t half as bad, or were more justified, but ultimately torture is torture and sadism is sadism. A culture or government that begins to permit such things and justify them is well on its way down the spiral with enough motivation. Let’s not fool ourselves into comforting racism or nationalism that our countries or people are incapable of atrocities of our own, even today.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164867.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. In the US it was common to do invasive surgery on infants without anesthesia until the mid 1980s. It was thought that newborns couldn’t feel pain.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164868.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. The New London School Explosion. On the afternoon of March 18, 1937, the shop teacher at the school in New London, TX turned on an electric sander. Unbeknownst to him, there was a massive natural gas leak under the school. The sander sparked, which ignited the gas and caused a massive explosion that [unalived] almost 300 students and teachers. It was absolutely horrific. The force of the explosion was so great that a two ton block of concrete crushed a car parked 200 feet away. This event is actually why natural gas has a smell now. They started adding it after the explosion so that something like this couldn’t ever happen again.My grandfather was actually one of the survivors of the explosion. He never talked about it, even to his own family, so I didn’t really know too much about it (other than the fact that he’d survived) until after his death. Toward the end of his life, he’d suffered a series of strokes that left him pretty physically incapacitated, so my dad had given him a voice-activated tape recorder and suggested maybe he could record his memoirs for his grandkids to listen to someday. 12 Life Tips Everyone Should KnowAs it turns out, he did. We have hours and hours of cassette tapes of him telling the story of his (actually very interesting) life, including a big section on the New London school explosion. For the sake of everyone’s privacy, I’ll call my grandfather Papa and use an initial for anyone else.Papa was in eighth grade when it happened, in his English class at about 3:00 PM on a Thursday afternoon. At the beginning of class, Papa and his buddy T had been messing around and being loud in the back of the classroom (as eighth grade boys often do). His teacher, Miss M, had enough of their disruptions and made Papa switch seats with another student. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164869.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">He moved into the girl’s desk in the front row, and she moved back into his desk in the back of the room. When the school exploded, they were taking a test on the book Ivanhoe. Papa was knocked out for a short time, and when he woke up, he couldn’t see anything because the dust was so thick. He looked down and saw that his pencil had blown clear through his hand. When the dust cleared, he saw that the whole back of the room was gone. I won’t go into details, but there were bodies (and parts of bodies) everywhere. The students in the front half of the room survived. The students in the back half did not. That included Papa’s friend T and the little girl who’d been forced to take Papa’s desk because of his misbehavior at the beginning of class. If he hadn’t been acting up, he would have been [unalived] and she would have lived. He carried the guilt of her death until the day he died.Papa’s classroom was on the second floor. There wasn’t any way to get to the room other than the open cavity of the explosion. After the few seconds of initial shock wore off, he and another classmate jumped into action. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164870.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">They were the only two kids in the class who hadn’t been badly injured. They made a tourniquet out of a sock and a shoelace for a girl with a severe injury to her arm and dug out their teacher, who was alive, but badly injured. By then, men were running up underneath the hole, so Papa and the other boy started lowering the injured to them. Then those who could walk, including Papa, climbed down. He ran off to look for his older brother, B, to see if he was OK.As it turned out, B had been supposed to be in Geometry class. However, he and his buddy had snuck out to go fishing. The explosion happened as they were opening the door to head out to the parking lot. The force of the blast sent them tumbling head over foot across the lot. They were both banged up and dazed, but they survived. The rest of their Geometry class was [unalived]. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164871.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I don’t know that there’s a moral in the fact that both my grandfather and his brother survived because they were misbehaving that day. I do know that it weighed very heavily on both of them for he rest of their lives.There’s a lot more to his story about the day and the aftermath (most of it absolutely horrific), but I won’t go into all of it here. A few small tidbits though:- Papa and the boy who helped him rescue the other students from their classroom were both awarded medals and certificates of valor for their actions that day.- Nearly every family in town lost a child - some all of their children. I’m sure you can imagine the extreme toll this took on everyone’s mental health. Papa described New London in the months following the explosion as a “town with no children.” </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164872.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">To help with the healing process, the oil companies actively recruited families with kids to transfer in, so that there was some sense of normalcy when school started again in the fall.- Papa had played French horn in the school band. However, when school started up again, he was asked to switch to trumpet, as the entire trumpet section had been [unalived].A few years later, my grandfather went on to fight in World War II, and he saw some of the worst conflict in the Pacific (including Peleliu and the liberation of Manila). But he said that nothing he saw during the war was ever as bad as what he saw the day of the explosion. I’m always amazed that more people don’t know about it. It was major international news at the time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164874.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Anyone whos familiar with Mary, Queen of Scots most likely knows that she was beheaded, but many people dont know *how* she was beheaded. My APUSH teacher told my class this story and its probably one of the most simultaneously interesting, funniest, and saddest executions in history.The first thing to note was that Mary wore a red dress rather than a white one for a very specific reason: after the execution of a royal or high-class person, commoners would often tear off blood-stained fabric from their clothing solely to flex that they got their hands on the blood of a noble. With red fabric, it would be difficult to see actual blood on the dress. Smart move on Marys end.During the actual execution, it was said that Marys executioner was not very experienced and actually *missed* the initial swing, jamming the axe or whatever weapon they used into the back of her head rather than through her neck. This didnt [take out] her yet, though, and she instead made some sort of medieval olden-time exclamation that can be roughly translated to goddamn! </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164875.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">EDIT: After the executioner was done, he picked up her head by the hair, not knowing it was a wig, and the head fell out and rolled onto the floor (thanks Plug_5 and moiochi for reminding me)After Mary was properly [unalived], her body was left for public viewing, but the audience was surprised to see her red dress start to rustle before allowing Marys small terrier dog to climb out from underneath. Tragically, the dog refused to leave the body and eventually passed away after staying at the same spot for a lengthy amount of time.History buffs, please feel free to make any corrections as I heard this story a while ago and probably made a few errors in my recalling! :)TL;DR: Mary, Queen of Scots avoided crazy memorabilia-savers at her execution with a very intelligent move, got shanked in the head during a failed attempt, the executioner dropped her head onto the floor, and had her dog in her dress with her the entire time</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164876.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">16 People Confess Incredibly Dark Family Secrets</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. My cousin married a serial killer, she had 2 boys with him and he tried to kill one of them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164258.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. My uncle had always been a raging alcoholic. A dangerous alcoholic. Well, my aunt married him anyways. They went to Germany for their honeymoon. Only he returned. We asked about the aunt and he pretended like he had no idea what we were talking about and how he has never gotten married.About five years later he married again despite us all trying to tell the woman not to. They went to Jamaica for their honeymoon. Same thing. He came back without her. Again pretended like hes never married. We began suspecting he was killing them. We called the police. They investigated. Nothing turned up. And then the years later, he married again. But COVID happened and they havent gone on a honeymoon.Were not sure shed believe us if we told her. So we have distanced ourselves from my uncle and he remains as the secret we dont talk about. We dont talk about Bruno type situation.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164246.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. My cousin is really my sister. My Aunt and Uncle couldnt have kids so my parents did for them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164249.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. My father is the youngest of 13 kids. But actually my grandparents only had 9 kids. Grandpa ran a farm and had a truck to deliver the produce from his and the surrounding farms. During WW2 he drove to Amsterdam to deliver food and secretly brought back Jewish boys. He hid them on his farm pretending they were his kids. Partially very nice of him, but he also just needed extra hands to work. After the war most of the boys went home to family members, but 4 of them had no remaining family. He officially adopted those 4 boys and just went on as if they had always been part of the family.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164245.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. My moms brother and her dad secretly don’t like her but its sad because she loves them so much</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164250.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. My grandmother on my moms side might be the s**ttiest person Ive ever met. She treats me like c**p because Im a teenager, a girl, and I remind her of my mom who she also tends to treat like c**p. She caused my uncles divorce because she MOVED IN with him and his then wife because shes a hoarder and cant even live in her house anymore. Shes completely ruined my youngest cousin and now he worships her in such a creepy way. Shes also racist, homophobic, sexist, anti-vax, etc. I just hate her. And we cant find a way to cut ties because when were in her state she finds a way to figure out that were there and guilts my parents into visiting. I hate her so much.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164251.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. My grandfather, my Moms Dad, was in the Merchant Marines in the 40s during WW2. It turns out that he was actually honorably discharged in July, 1945 and NOT November, 1945 like hed told everyone. He stayed in California for 4 months, unbeknownst to anyone. To earn extra money to bring home, he made 3 porn movies. He was 32-33 at the time, a big, robust, good looking man. He was married to my grandmother already and my Mom wasnt born until 1947, so they were childless still. We never found any of this out until 1984, when my Dad got a hold of some VHS vintage porn from the 40s and watched it with my Mom. My Mom recognized him right away. He had a very distinctive tattoo on the inside of his lower left forearm. A buddy of his was still alive at the time (1984) and still living in California, so my Mom got in touch. Sure enough, the friend (in his 70s) confirmed it and told her about the 3 movies. He starred in them himself and eventually sent her copies of the other 2 films. My grandfather died in 1969, and my grandmother in 1983. According to my Mom, she was sure no one had any clue.The money my grandfather earned helped to pay off the only car they had at the time and the rest helped to reestablish their nest egg.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164252.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I thought my dad had died but apparently he sent me away because I was born with a hearing problem and I wasnt perfect enough for him. I also didnt know I had a sister until four years ago, because my father decided that because my older brother was born, dear old dad could send my sister and I away, putting us both up for adoption. My mom got in the way though and managed to claim me, but I only recently got in touch with my sister and oldest brother, as we all met at Dads funeral after he passed from cancer. Im not sad that hes gone, but I dont hate him. He hated me, but I dont have a reason to hate him. Im not sad though.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164254.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. It’s actually f*cking awesome. Grandfathers great aunt by marriage ran the most notorious brothel in Sydney and had a lifelong feud with another brothel owner. She did go to the other madams funeral when she died, but as reported by the newspaper “just to make sure the old b***h stays in the ground”. The whole feud started over a dog breeding scam! RIP Tilly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164255.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. That I was sexually abused for many many years by an uncle. When I finally worked up the courage to tell my mother, I was forced to keep it a secret so my grandmother wouldnt know the horrible thing her son had done. Im still holding onto this to this day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164256.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. At twenty-one, when I asked my mother why I had no siblings, she confided that I had actually been born a twin and my brother had died because I choked him with my umbilical cord. She said I must never tell anyone or mention it to my father because he was still upset that it was the boy who had died. I had wanted a brother or sister all my life so was deeply sad and felt incredibly guilty to the point where I unsuccessfully attempted to end my life. (There was other stuff going on too - death of my boyfriend of five years - so I was already in a dark place.)Years later when I was carrying my own twins I began to realise that parts of her story seemed unusual and looked into my birth records. And heres the darkest bit - it turns out there never was a twin. I never confronted her.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164257.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. It’s not actually disturbing or anything but somehow the fact my great gran got admitted to a psyche ward because she became suicidal has become something no one talks about. She died 5 or so years ago and I only found out this year that 20 years ago she was admitted for a few months and both my mum and gran are really ashamed of this fact.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164261.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Quite some secrets here.- My mom and her sisters were abused by the same uncle when they were little. No one believed my mom when she spoke back in the day, and her sisters never said anything until last year, I think.- My grandad from my moms side was a alcoholic and a violent person. He hit my grandma A LOT, and also hit my uncles when they were little. Everyone in town knows him as a great and kind person, and the greatest friend.- We dont know who my dads father is. My grandma never said a word, never will. The man I call my grandpa on his side doesnt Even look like him. Other people know who my bio grandad is, but no one seems to remember the name. Also my dad doesnt care so idk who my actual grandad is and probably will never know.- Word says my grandad from my dad found his wife sleeping with this other man and set her on fire, leaving her a huge very visible scar on her belly, chest and neck, almost to her face. He denies it all.Theres more, but its getting quite long, so Ill leave it at that.

## <a href="#linky13" id="linky12">32 People Who Have No Grip On the Real World</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. My friend stole my card information and bought loads of expensive stuff. I asked her if it was her before reporting it, knowing that a) she was going through a tough time and I wanted to give her a chance to make it right and b) that I could be in trouble for conspiracy to fraud if I reported it and they believed Id got stuff delivered to my friend to claim fraud for the money back. She said no, I thought someone else had done it so I reported it.When she got arrested she said she didnt think theyd take the fraud thing so far. She thought you could just call up banks to get the money back and they wouldnt investigate.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164148.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. My brother told me “I’m avoiding Asian people if I see them on the street or anything. You know, for safety because of the coronavirus.” He’s Asian. OUR ENTIRE FAMILY IS ASIAN.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164145.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Work with a girl who is a flat earther and on top of that denied the existence of space. When the topic came up and I disagreed she asked if I had ever been there... obviously I havent. I told her I have also never been to Japan and that does not mean it doesnt exist.She complained to management about my intolerance of her beliefs.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164146.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I dated this girl who believed her roommates were spying on her. That every time they had friends over and were hanging out in the common space and laughing, it was because they were spying on her in her room. She also believed the government was spying on her and her parents directly. Us dating lasted about a week and ended not just because the red flags, but because she tried to drop by unannounced after only being on a couple dates.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164173.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I will never forget the man who angrily told me, a wheelchair user with no feet and no prosthetics, to go down the stairs if I didn’t want to wait for the elevator (I had been talking to my friend, and mentioned we were going to be a little late because of the huge line).</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164147.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I knew a girl who cheated on her boyfriend. When he found out, he broke up with her. She said you cant break up with me, it has to be mutual.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164149.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Parents of a 35 years old woman, who was hospitalized after suffering severe anoxic brain damage 20 years ago. She had been in the same ward since, barely conscious.They refused to get her transferred to a more suitable facility for 20 years, saying that theres no reason to do so: those facilities are for lost causes, and their daughter is going to make a full recovery, finish school, get married and be totally fine.Working in hospitals got me quite a collection of these stories, but this one I thought was one of the saddest ones.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164150.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. An ex became really religious and Id still talk to her sometimes. Somehow the topic of flat earth theories came up and she said she thinks its actually possible that it could be true. I tried to explain that we have more than enough imagery and data indicating that the earth is round, and she said it could all be planted there by Satan.You just cant come up with a response to that.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164151.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. My mother, and a several people in my family, believe that God marks people. If someone ultimately has a good soul theyre white and Im sure you can guess where it goes from there. If only non-White did s**tty things that would make sense but you dont even have to look at much of the world to see that is not the case. When I try to bring up that tons of white people do awful things her logic is theyre lost souls that will eventually find their way. Meanwhile shell believe a non White will never find their way even if they act like they have. The level of delusion this takes is one of the most frightening things to me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164152.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. In college I had a roommate from the most sheltered part of Long Island. We met an exchange student from Switzerland and I swear to god she said this in complete seriousness: Oh wow I didnt know people actually lived in Switzerland, I thought there were just banks there!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164153.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. This was from a Regional manager of Starbucks, after they removed merit based raises that could go up to a 5% increase, changed to a flat 2% increase.When she asked if people liked the new raise plan,I said actually no, they feel unmotivated with no reason to perform any better than just normal.Regional manager “your staff need to realise working isn’t about money”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164154.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. I met a lady who thought that High Fructose Corn Syrup was a conspiracy by the OIL INDUSTRY, to kill more people so that their bodies would be cycled through the earth in order to produce more oil.Yknow. The oil Cycle. That process that takes billions of years??Talk about a long con.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164157.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. The pastor of a small town church *insisted* that members set up the parish hall and provide food and beverages for 125 people after every Sunday service, even though the average attendance was only around 20 people.Week after week, month after month, much food would be disposed of and large urns of coffee dumped down the sink - and all because the pastor was in denial about the reality of weekly attendance.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164158.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. My cousin was spoiled and sheltered her entire childhood through college. Then her parents stupidly cut the leash without any preparation and released her into society.She quickly got in trouble for bouncing checks all over town. My mom picked her up and asked why the hell she was writing bad checks everywhere. Turns out my cousin was under the impression that as long as you had checks in your checkbook, you had money in your account. She didn’t understand that you deposit in a number and then can spend or withdraw up to that amount.Please teach your kids basic finance.Note: this was like 1996 before it turns into a “who writes a check anymore” discussion.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164159.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I used to work at a software company in downtown Boston. One of the best perks of the job at the time was the flexibility in hours. Many folks had regular wfh days. Myself, I knew I could drop my kids off at school, get into the office by 9:30 and my boss had no issue with it whatsoever. Others with kids had similar arrive late or leave early schedules depending on their childcare.After a few years a new CEO comes in, spends a month observing how the office works, then calls for a company wide meeting. During the meeting she tells everyone she believes having a full office 8-5 is the most productive environment, and at the start of the next month, all wfh was canceled, and she wanted everyone in the office during those set hours. No showing up late or leaving early.A lively debate ensued, with discussions of there being very little warning, to pleas of flexibility, to concerns of making necessary childcare arrangements - especially given that in many cases (i.e. schools) we couldnt adjust those times. Plus, commuting into Boston sucks.After listening to all of these arguments, she finally responds with a long speech of appreciating the sacrifices everyone has to make to better the company, everyone doing their part, blah blah blah. She ends it by saying, I understand where youre all coming from! Years ago when my kids were little, my husband and I had to hire three nannies to cover all of the times we had to work!I remember we all looked around at each other, speechless. It was also the moment I realized I would have to start looking for another job. When the millionaire CEO thinks hiring 3 nannies is a relatable example to her middle class employees, its pretty clear shes not going to change her mind.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164160.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. My SIL legit believes she’s a strong, independent businesswoman who owns three major businesses. She does three MLM gigs.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164161.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. A friend posted on his story that he’s tired of seeing everyone posting bad haircuts on social media. Saying that since he has “financial stability”(Forex pyramid scheme.) that if they don’t have $30 for a haircut, they need to “re-evaluate their lives.” He had no clue these people were posting at home haircuts during a global pandemic...</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164162.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Had a friend who insisted she was in a relationship with a C-list celebrity whom she met once during a comic convention.All the celebrity’s Instagram and twitter posts were for her and everything had a meaning behind it.When the celebrity got married, she said that it was just for the media so she and celebrity could live a quiet life.When he didn’t do anything for her birthday, she had a breakdown. She went to therapy not long after.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164163.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. I was a stable hand of a very upper tier barn in a wealthy part of the country. The staff have to sign non-disclosure agreements to protect clients.On one particularly scorching July day, I overheard a client venting to another about how she was incredibly stressed and going to have a mental breakdown because her first choice catering company was all booked up for the weekend of her last minute yacht party.Im paycheck to paycheck and had probably a total of 3 days off since christmas. I would love for a yacht party to be my basis for a mental breakdown. Needless to say, the staff had a healthy chuckle on that one.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164164.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. I had a customer come into my office to rent a car. Said she had a reservation for a car, she didn’t. Told her our deposit structure and she SLAMS a $20 bill on the counter and exclaims that’s enough for a deposit. I politely tell her it doesn’t cover her minimum rate. She then proceeds to ask what rank in the military I am. Completely confused, I tell her I am the manager and that has nothing to do with our policy. Then she says she out-ranks me and I was disobeying a superior’s orders. I kicked her out and she threatened to deport me...a completely white Chicagoan male adult. I couldn’t even be mad at her lunacy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164165.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. I went to a private international school in London as a teenager, most kids there had parents working good jobs but in-between them were some filthy rich kids with parents in the oil industry or something similar.In 8th grade we were talking about our easter break and my friend from Belgium was talking about how his family had decided last minute to go there over the break, but had decided to drive there because there were no flights available.Then this Russian billionaire classmate of mine asked him why don´t you take a private jet?. She was so clueless when we started laughing.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164166.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Im fairly convinced that my current shift supervisor thinks anyone who works an overtime shift is doing it out of loyalty to the company, and not because of the 1.5x pay rate.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164167.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. My MIL told me that Pepsi has aborted fetuses in it and that drinking it will make you gay. As I was drinking a Pepsi.Other highlights from her: she doesn’t trust doctors and says they’re all paid off by the government to hide some ominous truth from everyone else.She believes covid-19 is a hoax and also believes it comes from 5g- how she believes both of them simultaneously is beyond me.She thinks anxiety and depression are myths and that church is the only answer.She thinks the only reason people don’t like Donald Trump is because he’s against abortion and if it weren’t for that 100% of the populace would adore him.I could go on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164168.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. There is a girl at my work that always b**ches about not making enough bc she makes 200-300 a paycheck. Then is always the first to leave early and always shows up late and has other ppl take her shifts. She asked me how I make 600-800 a paycheck. I said bc I work more. I’m currently at work taking over HER shift. She doesn’t realize if you don’t work more you’ll be paid less</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164169.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. My old boss at the time was a girl of 26 who got 4 million dollars from her mom a year to play with. Her mom is very wealthy in china. Her daughter is here trying to be a CEO of a company for funzies.I accidentally got a job at that company.One days she told us we were all going on a group outting for bonding. She took us to an outlet mall four hours away. Told the rest of us 7 people that she was going to go shop and shed see us later. That was code for dont follow me, f*****s. Every 2 hours shed let us know she was going to go unload her bags to the giant van they rented and would group text us telling us we can meet her there to unload as well. We all get paid under 50k. We have nothing to unload.By lunch she had proceeded to fill up the van with s**t. She then asks me where all my new stuff is and I said Im budgeting right now. She goes take out a credit card and go shop! Thats the American way! Seriously. Ok.By 9 pm her bags were taking up peoples seats and they had to sit with her stuff. She spent 30k. The rest of us spent about 70$. We were tired and bored and cold.To this day I still believe she thinks she did something nice for us, and doesnt understand how polarizing and not at all team bonding that was.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164170.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. My bosss wife 28, she grew up in a wealthy family and married to a man who was 3rd generation owning the company he was in, they were a regional power, etc.She was talking to a staff that in general - made 36K a year, mumbling about a staffer who was on his Honeymoon.Tennessee?! HA! Tennessee?! She looked around the room for everyone to join in. My GOD! How did she agree to that? We did Hawaii and that was *least* I told him was acceptable.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164171.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Working in a pharmacy>Hello. Can I get the yellow ones please?* Sorry, could I get your name first?>It doesnt matter, I just need the yellow round ones.* Did you have a prescription.>No. I always get them here - little yellow round ones.It went on like this for literally 20 something minutes.Heres what I found out in that time:By little yellow round ones, he meant red/orange circular Xarelto tablets. He had been on a lower dose a couple of years ago, he had not filled the yellow ones in over 18 months.There was one dispense tech who knew his name and knew his doctor, by sheer coincidence, shed greeted him every time he came in for the last 2-3 years.He physically had no idea how a pharmacy works. Hed only even been to this one, only ever picked up one medication and only through one tech who knew the doctor sent his scripts through everu few months.It was surreal, explaining reality to somebody who by pure fortune had never experienced it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164172.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. My mother and father were given $20,000 by my grandparents in 1965. My parents were able to buy a house with the money.Fast forward 50 years, my mother gave me and my sisters $10,000 each. She was unable to understand that we could not buy houses for half the price 50 years later and accused us of not being good with money because she was able to do it. At the time she was sitting on a s**t ton of money in the bank and was 100% aware that to buy a house in her neighborhood would cost around $1,000,000 so, 100 times the amount of money she gave us and 50 times as much money as her parents gave her 50 years earlier.God, if only I could be so good with money as she wss.Not saying the $10k wasnt nice. Just saying she expected us to become her neighbors with no understanding of inflation, while thinking half the amount she was given 50 years earlier should be enough while knowing full well the value of her house.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164174.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">31. My step-fathers grandpa suffered from psychosis in a strange way. He wasn’t able to distinguish mirror reflections from real life. He would often be found talking to the mirrors (his reflection) for hours. Later on, he wasn’t allowed to have any mirrors because he would believe that “that man” was there to kill him and often would turn violent. Turn violent as in he would start punching and clawing against the mirrors.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164175.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

If you are allergic to dust the fibers themselves will always cling to dust like velcro regardless of coatings composition or weave. You can get some carpets that are more resistant but if you or a loved one have a serious allergy carpet is a no-go… a myth of wool being better or triexta being better has been perpetrated by people thinking something all natural is always better when they still have the same issues.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164089.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Was bullied by a kid a lot in 6th grade. I met his older sister at a bar when I was 21 and slept with her.I didn’t rub it in his face since I never talked to him after 6th grade, but I’m sure he knows.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163727.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I made an entire bar break out in a brawl because I ate a bag of chips. No joke.Three guys were verbally harassing me in a small-town dive bar. This woman comes in from a smoke and yells to the bartender “give me a bag of chips!” on her way to the bathroom.He sets them down at her seat next to me. I inhale these chips and carefully slide them near the guys when they aren’t looking.She comes out, sees the bag and starts getting in their faces. Her husband sees the commotion and gets involved and fists start flying.I ducked out as the husband entered.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163728.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Got my Christian school bully’s parents divorced.I forget what TGIF show I lifted the bit from but when I met the kids mom I said “then who was that lady your dad kissed?”.Which set off a chain reaction that eventually led to their divorce that very year.I was just trying to be a smart aleck but I got a natural 20 and shit just sorta happened.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163730.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

They fought roaches and bugs for months.It’s the little things that help me get through life.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163734.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
