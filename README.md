<span style="font-size:4em">17. The only two countries from Latin America to officially send troops overseas to fight were Mexico and Brazil. Mexico sent a squadron of pilots who distinguished themselves in the Philippines in particular, whilst Brazil sent 25,000 troops to Europe who fought in Italy.In northern Italy, the Brazilians were ordered to advance towards a German-held town, supported by an American force and Italian partisans. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87134625.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

They took the town in the Battle of Collecchio, and then took the initiative to rapidly advance north and cut off a German infantry division. The Germans were using this area as a rallying point to stage a fighting withdrawal back to Italy, but the Brazilians killed or captured them all instead - within three days they’d killed 500, captured 15,000 (including two Generals) and taken 1500 vehicles and 80 guns. The idea of a fighting withdrawal was perhaps slightly fanciful, and the town held little strategic value, but nevertheless, the battle contributed to the remainder of the German Army in Italy surrendering just four days later. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87134626.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Possibly the only two fighter pilots in the world to fly through the Eiffel Tower during combat WWII fighter pilots in general from all counties were basically crazy as hell, they had none of the instruments pilots have now and were basically flying with only their eyes and basic radar, took a special kind of guy to step up to that challenge that’s why enemy fighter pilots had weird begrudging respect for each other even as they were trying to kill one another in the air-u/santichrist</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87134630.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

When the catholic church entered into a compact with Nazi Germany, he protested and turned his church into a haven for Jews, gays and slavs. This worked well until Germany took over Poland. Then, he was sent to Auschwitz. While there he would take other peoples punishments and eventually took the death penalty on someone elses behalf as well. What did the catholic church do?
