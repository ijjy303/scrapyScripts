<span style="font-size:4em">1. I shitted the bed and blamed the dog.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163725.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I heated up both sides of their pillow before they slept.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163737.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Was bullied by a kid a lot in 6th grade. I met his older sister at a bar when I was 21 and slept with her.

I didn’t rub it in his face since I never talked to him after 6th grade, but I’m sure he knows.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163727.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I made an entire bar break out in a brawl because I ate a bag of chips. No joke.

Three guys were verbally harassing me in a small-town dive bar. This woman comes in from a smoke and yells to the bartender “give me a bag of chips!” on her way to the bathroom.

He sets them down at her seat next to me. I inhale these chips and carefully slide them near the guys when they aren’t looking.

She comes out, sees the bag and starts getting in their faces. Her husband sees the commotion and gets involved and fists start flying.

I ducked out as the husband entered.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163728.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Hit a person with a cactus once…</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163729.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Got my Christian school bully’s parents divorced.

I forget what TGIF show I lifted the bit from but when I met the kids mom I said “then who was that lady your dad kissed?”.

Which set off a chain reaction that eventually led to their divorce that very year.

I was just trying to be a smart aleck but I got a natural 20 and shit just sorta happened.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163730.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. They usually do it to themselves from my experience I just sit back and watch the stupid and let them know I love this part.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163732.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Put the switch cover back on and left. They fought roaches and bugs for months.

It’s the little things that help me get through life.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87163734.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky8" id="linky7">30 Most WTF Things Ever Said by Kids</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Mommy, will you ever hurt me with a knife I told her no. She followed up with ok good. I know some moms do that she was 3 when this happened. She had never seen videos or anything that showed child abuse, so Im not sure how she was aware that some parents hurt their kids. Shes also never been abused by anyone.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161653.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Theres a bad thing in my room. Whats in your room? A devil dog. A dog? No, a devil dog. Its a dog thats also a devil.

My son said that to me in the middle of the night while standing in the door to my room, looking down the hall with his back to me. It was also right after I discovered NoSleep and binged all the top stories</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161679.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. When my daughter was around 4 yrs old, she had a habit of waking me up by getting 4 inches from my face and staring at me until I opened my eyes. Once my eyes opened, shed say, Mommy your face is pretty. I want to wear it on my face.

Ok, Hannibal, lets get some breakfast.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161651.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I have a freckle on either side of my mouth. My little sister once said that it looked like a good place to start cutting</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161674.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. When my daughter was 4-5 years old we lived in a two bedroom townhouse. It was just the two of us (mom and daughter, her dad passed away). She always crept into my bed at night but never said why. One day we were cleaning her room and putting away laundry and she got very agitated and said, “Why is he here now? He said he only comes at night.” I asked if she was talking about Dad. She said, “No the boy with no hands.”

We moved a few months later and she’s never come into my bed at night or mentioned him since.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161652.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. When my oldest son was about three he asked one night at bed time. Mommy I like you better than my fake mommy. Me whos your fake mommy? Him You cant see her. She tucks me in after you do.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161654.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. A few weeks ago I was getting breakfast ready for my 3 year old when he nonchalantly told me his Grandma fell down the stairs. About an hour later Grandpa calls us to tell us Grandma had fallen down the stairs.

Also last weekend my 3 year old said my sister was going to visit the next day and guess who showed up for a surprise visit...</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161655.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. My 3 year old grandson has babbled about plane crashes since he started talking. He would reenact (with toys) a plane chasing another plane and as the first suddenly dropped to the ground hed yell in a heart-rending scream, OH NO WE CRASHED! This was his first sentence. He did this over and over.

Early this summer hes 3 and Im reading him a bedtime story. I pause & look up at him and he said to me, Granny, I was a pilot, my plane was the Kitty Hawk. I crashed into the water when they shotted off my wing and shotted off my face.

It almost stopped my heart.


He looked so troubled and sad. I told him that he had done his best and I was very proud of him and that he was only a little boy now and needed to not worry about that but if he needed to talk about it he could anytime. I just hugged him.

I researched and Kitty Hawks were used by almost every country early in WW2.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161650.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. My two year old has a motion-sensored night light in his room. One night , he wouldnt fall asleep. He kept talking to someone/something and was playing. He hadnt eaten much for dinner, so I decided to get him up for a midnight snack. I made him some macaroni and cheese and fed it to him from a bowl as he sat on the couch and watched tv with me.

Suddenly the motion light turned on in his room, unprovoked. Odd, but whatever. It turned off again, and we went back to watching tv. Suddenly, my son stops, and looks down the dark, empty hall leading to his bedroom. His face lit up and he says, Hiii! He runs up to the darkness, and starts babbling to it, talking to it.

Then he runs back, grabs his fork, puts some mac&cheese on it, runs back to the darkness and holds his fork up to it, like hes trying to feed it. He started getting impatient that it wasnt eating, but kept baby talking it. Finally he gives up, waves and says, Buh bye! And then goes back to watching tv like nothing happened.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161656.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I have twin daughters. One day while playing outside, one looked up at the sky and said, The sky is cracked... and on fire.

My other daughter looked up and said, Yes.... the people are screaming.

Then they went back to playing with dolls. Fingers crossed theyre not predicting the future, everybody!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161657.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. My 3 yo daughter was going through the monsters under her bed phase. Lasted for weeks, and it was really wearing on her mom & me.

One night after mom tried to put her to bed, she tagged me in. After 30 minutes, I grew pretty frustrated. In a last ditch attempt, I promised my daughter that there werent any monster under her bed. She replied, I know. Now theyre behind you.

After that, I let her sleep with us for a week.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161658.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. My three year old son said, Next time Im a baby, I want to have green eyes. I asked him if he had been a different baby before being who he currently is, and he squinted his eyes, looked at me like I was an idiot, and said, Yes, papa.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161659.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Well, this morning I was lying in bed, my almost 2 year old came up, put her face right up to mine and I though maybe she wanted a kiss. Then she said mama, I want eat your eyes please.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161660.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. About 3 am I wake to find my 6 year old son just standing next to my side of the bed staring at me motionless. It was a very tense moment up to the point I asked him very easily you ok son??
He then came back with I cant sleep but I still wonder how long he stood there before I woke....</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161661.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. He started refusing to go downstairs (age around 3-3.5), terrified, saying there was an evil ‘angel man’ down there that wanted to hurt the whole family. Consistently drew the same picture of said angel man too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161662.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. My oldest kept talking in his bed past bed time. When we asked him who he was talking to he said he was talking to the floating white lady. I dont remember the description he gave us, but what I DO remember is kid #3 doing the same f*****g routine 8 years later...</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161663.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Once when my toddler was hugging me he quietly said “I won’t eat your bones.”
Oh, uh...much obliged...</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161664.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. When I was really small, my Dad would go out of town quite a bit because of his job. One night when he was at home, I went up to my Mom, who was in bed, and said, “Who is that strange man in bed with you?”

Mom blinked and said, “That’s your Father.”

Shortly afterwards, Dad stopped traveling so much.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161665.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Picked him up from daycare when he was 3. Driving home, totally quiet, him just staring out the window... he randomly asks hey dad, member that time we [passed away] in a fire?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161666.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Starting at about 18 months, my daughter had an imaginary friend. NBD. At first, we didn’t think much of it because she seemed to delight in its presence. She would talk with the friend, and play with him, and he was generally a protective presence although she said that he did like to get into mischief. After a few months of this, we started asking our daughter questions about her friend and she would give us very specific answers, like his gender, first and last name, age, hair, eye color, etc. My partner and I thought, wow, those are some really specific details for an 18-month-old to provide. So, we googled the name. Turns out, there was a boy who [passed away] in another state that matched the name, age, height, hair, and eye color of my kids “imaginary friend.” Now, thinking this imaginary friend to be a ghost, we asked my daughter if she knew how the boy [passed away], and she was correct. Mind blown.

After about a year of this “friend” hanging around, we summon the courage to message a group set up to memorialize the boy. We get a message back from the boys mom. Turns out she has the exact same profession as my partner and, months before we contacted her, had planned on visiting the city we lived in. We ended up actually meeting her later that year.

My daughter actually had this friend for about 3.5 more years and then he came around less and less. Every once in a while, she still talks about him, or sets toys aside for him. It’s crazy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161667.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. I used to say things my grandfather used to say a lot. Like yelling out in German at our dog. My grandfather [passed away] years before I was born.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161668.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. my youngest brother (5 at the time) asked me if I wanted to come to play with the girl in the wall. freaked me the f**k out</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161669.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. My oldest daughter occasionally sleep walks. A few weeks ago she came out of her room and into the living room where me and the wife were watching tv. I asked her what was wrong and all she said was The rabbits wont stop screaming. . Then she turned around and went back to her room. Kinda creeped me and the missus out a bit.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161670.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. My one year old will point to a spot on the ceiling, say awwww, make grabby hands towards it then begin tracking whatever it is she sees and blowing kisses at it. Im pretty sure its satan. Nothing good lives on the ceiling</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161671.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Looked over to see what my five-year-old niece was drawing. I was almost too afraid to ask who it was. A girl that cries is all she told me. I didnt want to know if it was in our house.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161672.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. My 5yo told me a story that went something like this: He said that Georgey-Porgery doesn’t come around anymore. I asked who Georgey-Porgey was he said “Georgey-Porgey is the man who comes in here at night. He said it’s not good to bang on walls, if you bang on walls all the beetles will fall onto your face and in your eyes and your mouth. Georgey-porgy and doctor Mecha are [deceased]. When you’re [deceased] you’re not anywhere anymore, dr Mecha says it’s really important not to [pass away], so don’t [pass away] ok?”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161673.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. My daughter told me (at age 4 ish) that Santa makes toys by popping the eyeballs out of [unalive] people and chasing them around the floor until they turn into toys. Wtf.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161675.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. My 4-year-old cousin said it was the girl sang to her at sleep I asked what is about her neck? She said Oh she has a snake neck Im never sleeping again</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161676.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. When my oldest daughter was in Kindergarten, she wrote and illustrated her first book titled “I Hope You Die in a Fire.”
She and her friends were really into Five Nights at Freddie’s at the time, so I guess you could call it a fanfiction of sorts.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161677.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. Telling this story on my Mothers behalf. Ever since I was little Ive been a sleepwalker. I dont know when it started or why all I know is that my mom was the one that would find me walking about and send me back to bed when I was living with her. Apparently one night (I have no memory of the event my mom told me the next morning) I got up, walked into the doorway of my parents room, and just stood there, head down, while softly muttering something under my breath. Mom tells me she woke up and nearly had a heart attack. As she got up to help me back upstairs I sloooowly turned around and walked myself back to bed. Moms locked her door ever since.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87161678.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
