<span style="font-size:4em">1. Nevaeh. Its heaven backwards. Anyone that tells you their daughter is named Nevaeh will also tell you that its heaven spelled backwards. Every time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158293.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Heard a lady yell at her kid. “Graceland Tennessee stop running around!”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158308.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I know a girl named Random. While at an Easter egg hunt years ago (eggs were labeled for each kid), I took the eggs labeled Random thinking they were up for grabs. Random’s parents were unamused to say the least.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158294.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. My neighbor was the 12th kid. His parents named him Twelver. That’s gotta be the worst I’ve ever seen.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158295.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. An ex had friends who named their kids Haight and Rayge (hate and rage). Good luck kids.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158296.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I went to high school with a guy named John John John. Yes, his first name, middle name and last name were all “John”.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158297.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Baby girl

Yes this was their legal name.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158298.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I work at a college and often go through the new applications to process them, Ive seen all kinds.

Most ridiculous name Ive seen thus far though:

Starscream Anakin as his first and middle names. He has a normal last name. When I first saw it, I was certain that it was a kid f**king with our application system. Then I met him in person, and he showed me his ID.

His name is legally Starscream Anakin. I get the Anakin part, but of all the Transformers to name your kid after, why on Earth make it Starscream? He was just awful.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158299.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Real name, silly: Batman bin Suparman. Hes a guy in Indonesia.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. My sister met some kids in an international airport named Yellow, Flash, and No Exit. My sister asked No Exit why his mom picked that name; he said when she couldn’t think of anything else she saw a no exit sign from her maternity bed and settled on that.

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Well... lets just say that the state I live in doesnt have a significant english-speaking population, especially in the rural regions, despite the official language of the country ( India) being English and most of the urban population being educated. However; I have friends whose parents gave them names like Benadryl, Goodbye, Very helpful and the absolute worst Dishwasher. This, however is because people from the rural regions ( especially in the North-East) come to the cities, and see words in ads and billboards that they find pretty and innocently name their children after a variety of brands. I dont always blame them, I had a family friend who came off as very posh and educated, spoke perfect English... but named his daughter Darth Vader. Some of them are just trolling. Do not underestimate people of the hills; they dont take your bullshit, educated or otherwise.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158312.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. When I was pregnant my now exMIL wanted me to name our son Rock which is stupid as it is but the last name is Bowler so my sons name would be Rock Bowler and I couldnt do that to the poor kid. My ex thought it would be funny to name him Rocky with the middle name Bal so his name would be Rocky Bal Bowler...</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158316.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. The neighbour of my dads ex had a son and daughter called Blaiyz (blaze) and Ainjayl (angel). I dont understand the strange spelling.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87158317.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">30 Dark Secrets Arlines Don't Want You to Know</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I used to be a flight attendant and when someone was really rude I’d just go to the computer we had to reset the inflight tv screens and I’d keep resetting theirs sporadically so that they couldn’t watch their movie. Very petty of me I know.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157181.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. A friend of mine who works for Emirates told me this little gem. Whenever they fly into Saudi Arabia, Emirates makes the flight attendants lock the entire galley including all the food, water and drinks, all the napkins and cutlery too. This is because in the past, Saudi Arabian authorities would come on board and literally take anything they want and walk out. And there was nothing the airline or staff could do.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157183.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I once overheard a phone call at the gate check-in. A flight attendant was hungover, slept-in and was going to be pretty late.

A minute later, the person at the kiosk made an announcement about how some pre-flight maintenance was going to delay the flight.

I was thinking like, you lying sonofab*tch. Lol</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157184.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Back pre-911 I was traveling globally for the military (not American. Canadian and Brit).

Whenever I stopped in at a major Canadian airport I would grab a mess of Air Canada luggage tags.

Alot of my American contemporaries would ask for them when flying commercial to put on their luggage, especially when flying through the Middle East and Africa.

The American luggage was targeted for abuser, theft, etc

They never touched Canadian bags.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157185.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If you bring a box of chocolates for the flight crew, you will get all the free snacks (and sometimes beers) they can throw at you.

My old coworker had been a flight attendant for like 20 years and knew all the secrets. This was his best recommendation for a good flight.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157186.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I worked for the ground crew at a private airport. Flights from other countries have to throw away all uneaten food right off the plane, as it is International Waste, and needs to be incinerated.

Additionally, if flights for private planes are delayed, their food that was standing by has to go somewhere... So they gave it to us. So tasty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157187.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Used to work for a UK airline (non crew).

It was normal for passengers that died onboard to be kept in their seats until landing. They would be wrapped in blankets and propped up to look like they were sleeping to not freak out other passengers.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157188.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Not a secret - but if you’re nice you can get quite a bunch of stuff for free.

Example - I was on a flight home (American Airlines) and there was a baby behind us that was just nooooottt having it. Pretty much cried all the way from Phoenix to Chicago. I felt awful.

I was in the aisle, and saw that both the parents were taking turns walking around with the baby. So I asked them if they wanted something drink or a snack…I figured even the human interaction would be nice.

I ordered them something and just went back to my movie. A few minutes later - I got a tap on the shoulder and got a little goodie bag with some treats, and drinks and a little voucher for 24 hour** access to the AA lounge.

Be nice people - it pays off!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157182.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Flight attendants get equally if not more annoyed when flights are delayed. A lot are paid only for the flight time - meaning they arent paid to sit at the airport to wait....or even to greet customers during onboarding...

For that reason alone, the longer the flight the better. Imagine working on a short route where your actual work is 3-4h but youre paid for 55 minutes as that was the duration of the flight.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157189.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Not a flight attendant, but used to be a supervisor for a major US carrier. We had an employee whose child had a science project about germs. She brought her kid in on an overnighted aircraft and they took samples from all over. The galley, lavoratories, seats, tray tables, just about everywhere. The area with the most amount of fecal matter was the tray tables. Yep. I also never drink anything that is never sealed because I have witnessed cleaners who clean the lavoratories then jump to the galley without changing gloves.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157190.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. My friend is a flight attendant, she told me they change their emergency code words every few months. Once an emergency code word (could be something like “marvellous”) is used by a crew member when speaking over PA to pilot, pilot will automatically lock cockpit and not open the door again no matter what.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157191.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. The Galley!

Not a Flight Attendant but exEngineer and trust me, if the aircraft galley were inspected like any other food business it would be condemned within the first trolley!

That’s excluding the dirty water tanks and cleaning crew using one rag from ceiling lights to floor trim.

If you ask anyone who maintains aircraft, you bet they’re buying their meal at the airport.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157192.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. The flight attendants already know what you are going to say. Every joke, come on, request, complaint. They KNOW you are going to say that thing. If this is their 3rd flight of the day, they’ve heard it 6 times already.

No one is clever on an airplane.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157193.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. You have a set limit of how many hours you can fly, and you need 12 hours of rest between duties, ive once seen a pilot Wait 2 unnecessary minutes to turn off the engine to make the flight attendant out of hours for the next day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157194.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I used to work as a flight attendant and Ive seen a lot of stupid and crazy [stuff]. The alcoholism, drug abuse and depression is common in the domain. Its hard for a lot of people to live a superficial life. Its fun at first to see new places and new destinations. But at some point rome or new delhi is just another place at work. Sound downing but Ive seen a lot people complain about this and me as well.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157195.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Former flight attendant here. First of all I’d like to say that everything varies from airline to airline and country to country. I worked for a Latin American airline. The environment was quite toxic, there was A LOT of harassment from the pilots and copilots.. some of them would abuse the position of power they had to make some indecent proposals to the air hostesses. Maybe this is not a secret but for me it was a shock when a pilot (aged 40+) would text me during my days off to hang out (I was 19), I don’t even know from where he got my number and I felt very uncomfortable around him. This was nothing in comparison to other things that many of us experienced.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157196.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. There is an alarming amount of things that can be broken/inop on a MEL (minimum equipment list) and the airplane can still fly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157197.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Pilots are on their phones or reading the newspaper all the time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157198.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. FA here... crop dusting. Basically farting whilst we walk down the aisle due to the bloating. If you fly frequently theres a high chance an fa has farted right by your head as they walked down the aisle.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157199.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. The toilets are near where we sit, and no matter how hard you try to cover the fact that you’re taking a dump. It makes a different noise than if you just go number 1.

No matter what stupid thing you see or read about getting a free upgrade 99% of the time it’s all bollocks.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157200.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. The only dirty thing about my job was the airplanes. they never wash the floors, the seats. it’s gross.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157201.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. We have a list with every passenger’s full name and seat number. Sometimes when we’re bored we’ll Google you.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157202.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. I buddy of mine has been a pilot for the better part of 30 years and says that back 15-20 years ago the Russian/Soviet pilots and crew had to been watched like hawks (sometimes even being locked in a room) because there was a high chance of them getting absolutely s**t faced before when they were supposed to fly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157203.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. This little secret has been in the news lately, pilots and flight attendants are usually only paid when the aircraft door is closed. I am a flight attendant for a regional carrier get paid per diem, about two dollars an hour from the moment we sign in until the moment our trip is finished. However, our hourly rate is only paid when the doors closed.

While the hourly rate might sound good ($20-50+ depending on carrier and seniority) we are typically only paid 75 to 85 hours a month.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157204.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Flying isnt glamourous, one of my friend got spit on and cornered by a passenger and the company and the police did absolutely nothing about it. Also have heard of a few pilots trying to get sexual favors in flight, to no avail (from my knowledge).</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157205.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Pilot is sleeping and co-pilot is flying and there are [passed away] bodies in the cargo.

Source: my mom who is a former flight attendant.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157206.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. With South African Airways, it was the fact that flight attendants were stealing from people’s bags.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157207.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Theres a special frequency called Guard that all aircraft are supposed to monitor. Its for emergencies, or for when an aircraft ends up on a wrong frequency and the controllers need to get contact with them to change them to the right frequency.

Its full of pilots meowing at each other, and people accidentally asking for gate assignments and making other radio calls.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157208.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Sex isnt really that common in flight (ldmcr is too small to do naughty stuff)... but in hotels it happens... and its usually the copilot doing naughty stuff</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157209.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. My roommate’s a flight attendant and she says the flight crew (including pilots) often stays at the same hotel and parties together, and that the pilots often sleep with flight attendants regardless of marital status. Idk if that counts as a secret of the industry, but she says it is.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157210.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Cell 39 was on the upper landing, and hard to see from outside. They were screaming at me to go up there and help. I said just wait, I need my other officer. They kept screaming there was no time. I had to go. It didnt feel right. I held my ground and as soon as my male officer opened the door they all disappeared. They just wanted to rape and probably kill me. I still get sick thinking about it.” - catsandalcohol13</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158984.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

I was a pretty small girl, probably only 100 pounds at the time. This guy easily had a foot on me.

When we got home. He took my keys, pager, glasses and tried to lock me in the bedroom. He also had the landline cut off. It took two tries but I finally escaped with what I could fit in my car.

We had numerous problems already, and I had three small kids, so I finally kicked him out. A few days later, maybe a week, he makes a fake Facebook page, and sends me a friend request. The only posts on the page were talking about killing me and my children, his suicide, and how he planned to do it that day. The most recent post was accompanied by a selfie of him in my backyard; a recent selfie, so he had been there. I was on my way home with the kids late in the evening when I got the request. I had stopped by my parents home the day before and gotten my dads 9mm handgun because he was sending messages through mutual friends about burning my house down.

I called the police as soon as I got home, and they didnt seem to think it was a big deal and didnt have an officer available to come check my house before we walked into it. I live in the middle of the woods and we have a rinky dink police force. Anyway, I made the kids stay in the car, I gave my oldest instructions on what to do if anything happened, and I had to sweep my own home, in the dark, with a 9mm in case he was in there waiting for me and my children, and it was terrifying.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Einstein wasn’t a great guy. Brilliant, sure, but kinda douchy in his personal life.

He refused to marry his long time lover for years, even after she got pregnant. The child was assumed to be given up for adoption, but no record has ever been found.

He and his wife, Mileva Marić, worked together on their research. People saw them do it. They made jokes about it at parties. He proudly told people that she did all his calculations. They only put his name on their work and he went on to claim all the credit - ignoring any work she had done. Part of their agreement was that she would get the Nobel prize money but he tried to prevent that.

She raised two children - one schizophrenic - took care of the house and tutored to bring in extra money because he couldn’t get a job for a long time. He started getting more notoriety and then began an affair with his first cousin.

He moved to a different country to be with his new hillbilly mistress. He divorced his wife and quickly married the new, younger model. He had rules she had to abide by, such as leaving the room immediately when told and not expecting or asking for any sort of affection except when necessary for appearances sake.

Elsa, his second wife, was dying and he worked nonstop because he didn’t know what to do (I guess). She was basically abandoned her last few months.

He cheated on both his wives, numerous times. Ignored his children. Oh - and he was pretty into his second wife’s daughter and thought about marrying her instead.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155851.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Coco Chanel was a goddamn Nazi spy. Yes, she was an incredible designer, and shes probably one of the most influential humans of the 20th century, based on the number of people who have worn clothing directly inspired by her over the past 100 years. She really did change the way women dress in a truly radical way, and I respect that - knitwear, feminized menswear, ditching the corset, transforming black into an everyday color, the essential skirt suit, costume jewelry, synthetic fragrances in perfume, the list goes on.

But she was a goddamn Nazi spy. Coco was a wretched anti-Semite, like so many other members of the European elite during the 30s. She dated a number of staggeringly wealthy British aristocrats and theyd all sit around talking about the Protocols of Zion and s**t, trying to figure out whether any members of the royal family were secretly Jews, etc. When war broke out, the two Jewish brothers who ran her perfume empire (aka Chanel No 5, the best selling perfume in the world then and now) had to flee to the US for safety. How did Coco respond? By writing to the Nazis to ask them to transfer ownership over to her, a good Aryan, so she could make more money. But thats not the half of it.

She fell in love with a dashing German spy named Spitz whod been seducing bluebloods all over France and England for years leading up the war. Coco was a useful woman - she was simply one of the richest women in the world, and she knew everyone in the British aristocracy, including her old hunting buddy and dear friend, Winston Churchill himself. She and Spitz socialized with all the biggest Nazi names in town, especially Otto Abetz, the Nazi ambassador to France, who invited them to every party in town. Spitz convinced her to join the Abwehr (aka the German secret service) and make trips to Spain. Operating under the code name Westminster, she attempted to broker a separate peace between Germany and England. (In the meantime, she may or may not have reported at least one woman at the Hotel Ritz whom she suspected of being Jewish to the SS.) She had a grand old time going on her adventures, and wrote about the excitement of working for the Abwehr in her private notes.

Chanel was arrested only a few days after the liberation of Paris - absolutely everyone in town knew what shed been doing and who shed been doing it with - but for rEaSoNs UnKnOwN she was released without charges. Its widely believed that Winston Churchill personally intervened. It might be because the two of them had been close friends for decades. It might be because she was going to embarrass the s**t out of Britain by outing all the anti-Semites and pro-Nazis in the British aristocracy - including the recently abdicated Edward VIII who used his f***ng honeymoon as an excuse to tour Nazi Germany and shake Hitlers hand. She spent the rest of her life being a nasty, bitter morphine addict living in the Hotel Ritz. The House of Chanel has very, very little to say about the matter, and every few years a few more bits of damning evidence are declassified from the vaults.

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Kinda coming much more into light now but The Founding Fathers, all of them owned slaves and by modern day standards they would be horrible people. But something I think lots of people don’t remember is even if these things are utterly reprehensible, everyone was doing it and they were all children of their time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155857.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Benito Juárez

He was the type of president who kills his opposition instead of negotiating. He did a lot of illegal executions.

He was going to be executed in Guadalajara, however one of his ministers convinced the soldiers not to kill him with a famous phrase alto, los valientes no asesinan, the soldiers forgave his life and risked theirs as the disobey an order. Well, as soon as Juarez returned to Mexico city, he immediately ordered to kill all of those soldiers with no mercy (source: my sister worked with the Sargents descendant)

After Juárezs government, theres a period Known as the porfiriato, where Porfirio Díaz was Mexicos president for 30 years. It was possible just because there was no opposition alive

Juarez suddenly died in 1872 from a heart attack. Its believed that a woman, to avenge his husband, worked on his home as a maid, and when she had the opportunity, she put an infusion of veintiunilla a herb known by the natives for being poisonous and cause a heart attack 21 days (veintiún dias) after it was drank</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155858.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Not quite beloved, but Joseph P. Kennedy Sr..

He decided that Rosemary (his daughter) who was 23 at the time should have a lobotomy; he did not inform his wife of this decision until after the procedure was completed. And then they sent her away to an institute.

In her early young adult years, Rosemary Kennedy experienced seizures and violent mood swings. In response to these issues, her father arranged a prefrontal lobotomy for her in 1941 when she was 23 years of age; the procedure left her permanently incapacitated and rendered her unable to speak intelligibly.

<span style="font-size:4em">22. William Hurt. I remember seeing tons of praise for him when he passed recently.

Thing is, he beat and raped Marlee Matlin back in the 80s. She discussed it in her memoir. When he was approached about it, his response wasnt to deny it, but to apologize for any pain he may have caused to her.

If you want to praise his acting, fine. But remember what sort of person he was behind the characters you loved on film.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155861.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Joseph Smith-

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Margaret Sanger was pro-eugenics and a racist.

In promoting birth control, she advanced a controversial Negro Project, wrote in her autobiography about speaking to a Ku Klux Klan group and advocated for a eugenics approach to breeding for “the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extinction, of defective stocks — those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.”

She always had great stories about her travels and generally spoke positively of every country she visited. The one time I really remember her speaking negatively, or saying she didnt like a location was about India. It was something about the extreme wealth juxtaposed with extreme poverty and slums right next to each other. However, Im not sure when she traveled there.
