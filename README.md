Which was a very bad call. She said we need to discuss this in person send your best troops to escort me to you and we can do the planning. The best troops show up and are immediately buried alive. So next she is like I guess your troops never showed up have your army meet mine outside of your city and we will celebrate our soon to be union. They agree and are like this all seems legit let’s get real drunk. Olgas troops stay sober and kill everyone of their troops when they’re too drunk to do anything about it. At this point the drevlians figure out they no longer have a military, and they are begging her for peace. They’re like name your terms and she says I want 2 pidgeons and 3 sparrows from each house. They all had thatched roofs, so they brought her the birds and said thank you leave now. She then had her men tie a little burning sulfur to each of the birds feet and set them free to fly home and burn down every single home. All as a f**k you for killing my husband.” - themightythor2024</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191465.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. “A personal favorite of mine has to do with Dante Alighieri (writer of the Devine Comedy, the first part of which is Dante’s inferno) Aside from the fact his poem the Inferno itself is a self insert fan fiction where Dante gets to say “f**k you” to the people he didn’t like, one of the best stories actually happened following his death. His hometown of Florence kicked him out years earlier but eventually learned of his fame and influence and decided to claim him back from the city of Ravenna where he lived his last days, and they were like “No! Our famous poet!” So Florence got the Pope himself involved and forced them to give the remains back so Ravenna relented but instead they sent the monks an empty coffin. The monks actually looked in and found nothing but couldn’t exactly let everyone know that they committed a bit of a major taboo so they just let the matter go and Dante remains buried in Ravenna to this day (far as I know.) I can just imagine Dante’s spirit rolling with laughter at even in death he bested the city he once loved and grew to resent.” - Story-Enchantress16</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191482.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

He was incensed at the reply, and not only vowed to never buy another Ferrari, but to begin building his own supercars to show Ferrari how it was done. And today, the cars of Ferruccio Lamborghini are famous worldwide.” - FlashpointJ24</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191483.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. “Joan of Arc’s trial was known to be tedious as the Church tried their hardest to find grounds for a conviction. In an attempt to trick her, she was asked whether she knew if she was in God’s grace. Since the Church believed no one was able to know if they were truly in God’s grace, either a yes or no could be condemnable. She responded by saying, “If I am not, may God put me there; and if I am, may God so keep me”. Reports on the trial say that the court was stupefied by her deft answer. It was basically a mic drop in the face of the Church at the hands of what they saw as an illiterate and heretic farm girl.” - bluewolfgirl</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191484.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

One night she woke up scared and went to my parents’ room to sleep with them. Before she went back to sleep, she used their bathroom, and when she came out she said “Why are there people in your bathroom mommy?” Dad was out of town, mom still swears this was the scariest thing any of my siblings ever did. -u/TheKrazyKrab23</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87193097.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

After he calmed down, he told my mom that I refused to stop staring him down in the rear view mirror with a very serious look on my face. He had asked me to stop on several occasions but said I never really replied. I just kept staring menacingly. Then, he said all of a sudden I looked into his eyes and said, “Papa…. I’m going to hippo-tize you…. I’m going to put my toe… in your mouth.” My mom said she thought it was funny at the time, but couldn’t laugh because my grandfather was seriously so enraged.

Me: (half listening) Uh-huh, sure that sounds… wait, what??
Son: yeah when our house explodes, be ready and we’ll just run out real fast (and then he turned back to playing with cars like nothing was said)

<span style="font-size:4em">17. When I was about six or seven, the house we were renting was going to be sold. My parents instructed us to keep our rooms tidy because people may be walking through the house during showings. I had the idea to take a little box and write “fortunes” on it. Inside were little slips of paper with “fortunes”. The idea was that prospective buyers could take a slip of paper to get their fortune, kind of like a fortune cookie.

<span style="font-size:4em">
I remember the first couple of slips of paper said stuff like “you will have good luck”. Then the rest of them had some pretty morbid stuff like “you’re going to die”. My parents read the slips of paper beforehand, then sat me down and sternly told me the fortune box was a no-go. I was a pretty serious child, it didn’t occur to me that a fortune box should be light-hearted. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87193110.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
