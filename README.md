###### 38. Not discussing your income with coworkers. At least in the US, employees are protected, so they are allowed to discuss income amongst each other without fear of getting fired for it. However, a lot of companies have kept the idea that it is taboo or that your job may be at risk for doing so and a lot of people still buy it to this day.Yes, most people that live in the US know that all states (except Montana) are at-will states, meaning that they can fire you for no reason at all, meaning that while technically they wont fire you for discussing pay, some companies will not like it and find any excuse to let you go, so keep that in mind.Also, some companies will try to stop if right off the bat by having it in your employee handbook that you are not to discuss pay, so make sure you check that out in your case. My company actually has the opposite, stating that they will never go after someone for discussing pay, and they even have it posted in public areas. However, Im not naive and understand that while it may seem that way, they can just be doing that to protect themselves, so who knows. Ive been there for a few years now and we have not heard of anyone getting fired for anything that could be even remotely related to pay discussions.The point of my comment was to let people know that the idea of discussing your pay with other employees being a no-no or taboo is an antiquated idea started by greedy companies decades ago to help keep the average worker from demanding better wages that they rightfully should be getting in the first place, and that legally they cant outright fire you simply for doing that (with exceptions, of course). I myself have no issues letting anyone know how much I make if they ask, and if they use that to get themselves properly compensated, then Im happy for them at the end of the day.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87123156.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#39" id="38">19 Common Things Most People Don't Use Correctly</a><br>

###### 1. The protective plug with a ring right under the main cap may actually be useful. If you turn the ring down and put it back into the bottle’s neck, it will work like a valve. You can use it to control the amount of oil that pours out of the bottle.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124827.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 2. If you often notice the food in the microwave oven heating unevenly (the edges are hot and the middle is cold), try putting the plate near one of the edges, not in the center. This simple trick will allow you to heat the food more evenly.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124828.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 3. Red plastic cups are usually the star of the holidays. And the lines we see on them are also related to these festivities. They are not part of the design, nor do they serve to grip them better, contrary to what we might believe. These lines are measurements. They indicate the amount to be served according to what you are drinking, the daily amount of juice for kids, and even portions of mouthwash.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023737/87125926/87040576.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 4.  Laundry pods might be completely useless if you put them on top of the laundry. The right way is to put them into the washing machine first and then put the laundry on the top. By the way, if you wash clothes at a low temperature, the shell of the pod might not dissolve in the water completely and it could leave stains.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124830.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 5. There are loops on shopping carts that can be used to hold your grocery bags, keep them upright if they have fragile items, or store extra if you’ve got a lot of groceries.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023412/87125923/86520379.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 6. There are tiny markings on tape measures that are there to help you find the right position for wall studs. These black diamonds are known as “stud finders,” and they can help mark the center point between two studs.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023436/87125925/86520390.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 7. To make the deodorant as effective as possible, you can also use it on your legs, the inside of your thighs, and other body parts that produce a lot of sweat. It’s not just for your armpits!<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124831.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 8.  A TikTok user found an unusual way to solve an old problem — how to put a blanket into a duvet cover. You need to put the blanket and the duvet cover on the bed, match the corners, and make a roll. After that, open the slip, put the blanket inside, and button up the slip.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124832.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 9.  Today, we rarely use the drawer under the oven the way it was meant to be used. It was supposed to be the place where you store the meal you’ve just cooked to keep it warm while the dessert is being cooked in the oven.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124833.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 10. To make the blender work better, you should stick to the right load order. We usually put berries first and then add milk. But in fact, it’s better to do it the other way round.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124834.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 11. If the pillowcase is a bit too big for the pillow, professional cleaners recommend not leaving it hanging loose. They recommend folding it inside, which makes the bed appear neater.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124835.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 12. In the past, Kleenex had a totally different purpose. They were meant as gas mask filters, and then the company started offering them to women to use during their periods. After that, the manufacturer reconsidered the formula, made the product softer, and started selling them as a makeup removal product.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124836.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 13.  Spending a bit of time understanding your plungers can be useful, though, because different plungers are used for different problems. A flat plunger is fine for a sink, but if you need to use one on your toilet you’ll need one with a tapered end.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023423/87125924/86520380.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 14. Everyone has probably argued about how a toilet paper roll should be hung. Now, we have an answer thanks to the 1891 patent received by New York businessman Seth Wheeler.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124837.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 15. There is a thing inside the lid thats designed to get just one piece out. Flip the box, then turn it on its side, and open, there should be one Tik Tac sitting in its place.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023358/87125920/86520355.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 16.  Isnt it annoying when you need to use foil, often the whole roll comes out. There’s a simple solution right there on the box, it even says: “Press Ends To Lock Roll” and that’s exactly what it does. If you look on the sides of the box, you will see the little grips, you just push them in and they hold the roll in place.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023401/87125921/86520363.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 17. That drawer at the bottom of your oven isnt for storing pots, pans, and baking sheets, its actual purpose is to keep your food warm.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023410/87125922/86520367.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 18. To ensure the maximum efficiency of the dishwasher, don’t overload it and put plates on top of each other. Also, experts advise putting plates from carbs (potatoes and tomatoes) in the middle and protein (eggs) — on the edges.If you do this, the carb spots will be under the most powerful water streams. And the edges will soak for a longer time which is perfect for protein spots.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124829.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 19. Chinese takeout containers can be unfolded into a plate.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023738/87125927/85959564.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
