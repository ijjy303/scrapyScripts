<span style="font-size:4em">1. Before becoming a world-famous actress, Jennifer Aniston tried herself in many roles on projects that were not very successful. Once, the actress ran into the former president of NBC Entertainment, Warren Littlefield, at a gas station on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129947.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

When he finished gassing up his car, Aniston asked him, “Will it ever happen for me?” Littlefield thought for a while and answered, “I wanted it to.” Soon after, she was invited for the audition for the Friends series, where the actress got the cult role of Rachel Green.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129951.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. In his student years, Brad Pitt was studying journalism but dropped out of college 2 weeks before graduation. World fame didn’t come to him all at once. Pitt had to agree to take any job to be able to pay the bills. He worked as a mascot at a cafe wearing a chicken costume and gave rides to female dancers to bachelor parties.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129959.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

According to the actor, these jobs gave him a chance to find the right contacts and brought him to acting teacher, Roy London, who helped him unfold his talent and get his first roles in movies.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129949.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Pamela Anderson worked as a fitness instructor until she was “found” at a football game in Canada. She came to the game in a tight-fitting t-shirt with a logo depicted on it and was broadcast on the stadium’s giant screen.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129950.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

 The unexpected advertisement pleased the representatives of the company, and Anderson was offered a contract. Soon afterward, she was doing photoshoots for magazines and then got her iconic role on Baywatch.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129952.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. 17-year-old Chloë Sevigny was skateboarding with her friends in the East Village in New York when she accidentally met a photographer from a magazine about music and fashion, i-D. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129953.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

The latter offered her a photoshoot, and Chloë didn’t miss her chance. Now the world-famous model and actress considers this photoshoot the best one in her career.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129954.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. David Boreanaz had been trying to get on the big screen for years by taking part in many auditions but his dream came true thanks to an accidental meeting. In 1996, Marcia Shulman, the casting director of the cult series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, was looking for a handsome guy to fill the role of Angel — a tortured vampire with a soul. But all was in vain.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129955.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

That’s when her friend, who noticed Boreanaz while walking her dog, came to the rescue. The actor was approved for the role and he remained the star of the TV series for the next 25 years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129956.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129948.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
The businessman first saw the future icon of the 1940s and 1950s in a cafe when she was drinking soda with her friends and instantly realized that he was looking at the future star. Wilkerson introduced 16-year-old Turner to talent agent, Zeppo Marx, who helped her get a small role in the movie They Won’t Forget. Soon afterward, her great career on the big screen started.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129957.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Before becoming a superstar, John Wayne went by the name Marion Morrison and played as a forward for the University of Southern California.

<span style="font-size:4em">

Afterward, he gradually switched to more iconic roles and even won an Oscar in 1970.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129960.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Justin Bieber has been into music from early childhood — he played drums, piano, guitar, and trumpet. At the age of 12, he took part in a singing contest in the Canadian city, Stratford, where he took second place. The mother of the young artist posted his video on YouTube to help other members of their family and their friends watch it who were not able to attend the performance. Afterward, she uploaded several videos where Justin was singing popular song covers in a rhythm and blues style.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87129961.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

This one day Im working on my motorbike out in the shared car park, when the mother turned up in her Ford Ka and parked next to my parents car.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Had a neighbor leave a note on my then-girlfriends car saying she wasnt allowed to park in front of their house because their taxes paid for that part of the street.
