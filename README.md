## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">25 Comedic Actors Who Became Fantastic Dramatic Actors</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. John Goodman His performance in 10 Cloverfield Lane was nothing short of perfection. The look of pure evil in his eyes when he killed that guy was horror at its finest.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170240.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Cranston did a spectacular job in Breaking Bad. I was never a big fan of Malcolm in the Middle (it was just ok), but going back through old Seinfelds on Netflix and Cranston as the dentist is hilarious.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170241.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Gene Wilder to me is special. He’s what my model of a complex sensitive man was growing up. Somehow not conventionally good-looking but sexy in that 70s way. Tender, sometimes furious, frantic, sophisticated, intelligent— and sings and dances. I loved him so much. And with Pryor, forget it. Even their mediocre films had such beautiful chemistry.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170242.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Bob OdenkirkHe seems kinda surprised about it, watching his interviews. But damn he does both well in the same role.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170243.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Olivia Coleman. Loved her in Hot Fuzz but was pleasantly surprised by her in the Favourite.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170245.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Hugh Laurie. Went from A bit of Fry and Laurie to Blackadder and then out of nowhere, House MD and then again with Night Manager.That man knows acting!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170246.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. John Lithgow. Seeing him in Dexter was a decent mindf*ck.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170247.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Tom Hanks, if you remember him from his early career in the early 1980s, he was a talented comedy actor... but no way would I have imagined him doing dramas, let alone starring in them, let alone a string of hits.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170250.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Robin Williams. His performance in One Hour Photo is creepy as hell. The dude was absolutely a phenomenal actor no matter the genre. Insomnia has another great performance of his as well.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170251.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Jason Bateman. He has this way of making an insult sound like a compliment. F*cking gold.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170255.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Jim Carrey. I actually don’t like his comedy, but I love The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Truman Show.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170258.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Steve Martin transcends acting. He is a great comedian, comedy actor, and dramatic actor, yes. But, he’s also a great musician, artist, writer, and I assume some kind of scientist.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170259.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Jackie Gleason, from his own entertainment show, to the Honeymooners, to the Sherriff in Cannonball Express, has done some fantastic roles, Minnesota Fats, but one you might have seen is the 1986 film Nothing in Common with Tom Hanks.Gleason is so good, you can sense Hanks soaking up all the acting chops.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170260.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Donald Glover.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170261.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Jonah Hill. So he and the director of 21 Jump Street basically had to bully Channing Tatum into reading for that movie, because Channing had never done a comedy before and didnt think he could pull it off. Turns out he was so funny that Jonah Hill was almost offended, because the short fat guy is supposed to be the funny one, not the big tall handsome guy. Jonah thought it was just a little unfair that a guy who looked like Channing could also be a natural comedic talent.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170264.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I know someone who was doing a semester abroad in China during college. She let her boyfriend at the time fly out from the US for a week+ visit, knowing she was going to dump him the second she saw him.

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">20 Jobs That We Have Zero Respect For</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Scammers that scam old people via phone calls.

<span style="font-size:4em">5.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. MLM managers. Not the low level idiots that get suckered into it, they suck too for trying to bring new people into that sh*t-show, but the people who create them know exactly what they are doing.

<span style="font-size:4em">I know there are poachers that come from rural villages who are trying to just put food on the table, which have my sympathy.

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Jerry Lewis. He treated his family like shit, cut his kids out of his will and was a real pos on set. Watch some clips on youtube of him and his behaviour. Terrible. Most likely stemming from when he and Dean Martin split from being Martin & Lewis, everyone thought Dean would disappear and Jerry would go on to be a massive star. As it turned out, it was the complete reverse. He was a bitter, bitter person.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170033.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Bing Crosby. Father of the Century. Physically and mentally abusive to all his kids, alcoholic, adulterer, slimy businessman. Check it out....</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170034.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Frank Lloyd Wright. He is seen as a visionary in architecture but he was a horrible person IRL. Raging narcissist, abandoned his wife and kids to run off with the wife of one of his clients, nailed down his selected furniture in a clients home because he didnt like what the client wanted, etc.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170035.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. No one will say it because Americans have a hard time grappling with the military not being heroes, but Chris Kyle was a racist and a liar.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170031.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Jimmy Savile. Absolute monster. His celebrity as an English radio and tv personality gained him unrestricted access to hospitals with disabled children whom he abused. That’s putting his life very lightly. Beware if you go on to read more about him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170040.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Johnny Carson. He cheated on his wives and was an all around prick when he wasnt on camera. The most widely know example was him telling Joan Rivers that shed never become the star of The Tonight Show (she was the permanent guest host at the time), then refusing to ever speak to her again after she got a job elsewhere.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170043.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. By some Stones fans, Brian Jones. He deserves to be honored for his role innthe band, and for his musical contributions, and its a shame how his life ended, but he also had a history of domestic violence.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170047.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Picasso has been commonly characterized as a womanizer and a misogynist, being quoted as having said to one of his mistresses, Françoise Gilot, Women are machines for suffering. He later told her, For me there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats. In her memoir, Picasso, My Grandfather, Marina Picasso writes of his treatment of women, He submitted them to his animal sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them, and crushed them onto his canvas. After he had spent many nights extracting their essence, once they were bled dry, he would dispose of them.Of the several important women in his life, two, Marie-Thèrése Walter, a mistress, and Jacqueline Roque, his second wife, committed suicide. Others, notably his first wife Olga Khokhlova, and his mistress Dora Maar, succumbed to nervous breakdowns. His son, Paulo, developed a fatal alcoholism due to depression. His grandson, Pablito, also committed suicide when he was barred by Jacqueline Roque from attending the artists funeral. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170048.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Since no one mentioned them yet. Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. In her letters De Beauvoir mentions several romantic and sexual relationship with female students of hers, in one case she met a 17 year old student who she had a relationship, and later introduced her to Sartre who also began to have sex with her. There were a few others who basically made up Sartre’s personal harem, while de Beauvoir acted as the pimp; seducing teenage girls into threesomes with Sartre.Additionally both were signatories of a petition to remove the age of consent laws in France; the petition was written by a known pedo,Gabriel Matzneff, and signed by other French intellectuals including Foucault; who himself has been accused of sodomizing boys. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170050.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Lou Reed, I love the Velvet Underground but many of the band members were awful.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170051.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Frank Sinatra. My grandpas girlfriend and her husband used to work for him, and he was a right bastard. Didnt think that he had to pay people that worked for him, treated employees bad, all the usual human stuff. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170052.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I’ve worked for Prince and it’s a not so hidden secret he was absolutely awful to work with. There used to be a saying “you’re nobody in this industry until you’ve been fired by prince” He’s a legend for sure but was awful to those who put the show on, and his ego was out of control. And when it came down to it, he died from an OD, so for someone who was so quick to fire anyone over a simple mistake and he so critical of weakness, it turns out he had some hidden weaknesses of his own. Also, from all accounts Jim Morrison was an awful awful person.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170054.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky12" id="linky11">23 Dirty Secrets Industries Are Hiding From The Public</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Midway games at carnivals or fairs purposely let people win early on in the day. This way people carry around the prizes and advertise them for the rest of the day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169111.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I was a deep sea diver for 10 years in the Gulf of Mexico. Huge oil spills happen and are covered up hundreds of times a year by every company. The entire industry is in on it. The bottom of the gulf is a disgusting garbage dump. Every boat dumps their trash into the gulf no one obeys the laws and the coast guard doesnt enforce s**t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169110.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I work in payroll. The number of payroll reports I see where people are conned out of their overtime is saddening.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169113.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Record labels and producers sometimes use ghost vocalists for pop stars who really cant sing. Ghost vocalists are like singing impressionists who come into the studio and re-sing the song in the style of the popstar, but better. Often the popstars in question dont even know that their vocals have been replaced.

Oh and, for the record (no pun), terrible singers cant be fixed with autotune, it is only used to polish slightly untidy vocals. This is why ghost vocalists are used.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169114.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Nearly every caller you hear on top 40 radio is either an intern or someone else close to the studio, everything is fake.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Not sure if this is an industry practise, but a very popular online retail company in my country has no in-house web designers or any other IT staff beyond your generic networking techs. Any time their website or backend systems need work they simply advertise a permanent position and give the job of sorting out whatever they need done as a trial for the candidate. Once completed, they then inform them that the position is no longer available and send them on their way. Theyve been doing this for years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169116.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I work in a shipping company. Im a merchant marine engineer working on mega container ships. Lot of unethical shipping companies. They dump a lot of garbage, oily sludge, waste, contaminated water, and oil out when sailing in international waters far away from the shore because its cheaper to do that than land the waste to correct shore reception facilities. There are only a few handful of players (I can count them on my fingertips) today who are actually executing business trades, while still keeping the carbon footprint and environment as one of their core policies.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169117.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. When a movie trailer has shots that turn out to be missing from the actual movie, thats not because scenes were cut. Those shots never existed in the movie.

<span style="font-size:4em">1. A friend of mine works for a small luxurious hotel in London.He told me the concerge system there is absolutely absurd. Money buys everything.Anything the clients want, clients get. They are told never to say no, worst case they say I dont think this is really appropriateObviously drugs and escorts are a classic. He showed me 20 phone numbers of drug dealers in his phone to be able to get whatever drugs to the customers (he never buys though, only gets people in contact).And for harder tasks, he goes through professional concierges who charge A LOT.- You want a new Prada dress at 2AM for the party you are about to attend? Sure thing, lets wake a few people up, charge triple the price and split the benefit between people involved. Have a good night madam.- You want tickets for the Wimbledon final that takes place tomorrow? You have £20k? Enjoy the game, sir.But in some cases, they cant satisfy the customer. So when a couple of clients came back drunk asking him to have sex with the wife while the husband was watching and filming, he felt like it was a good time to say I dont think this is really appropriate. - Eco-reddit

<span style="font-size:4em">2. My husband worked at several luxury hotels and residences (rich people who live at the hotels) and besides how absolutely disgusting everything inside the rooms actually is...I was most shocked by the behavior of the ultra rich.I’m not talking businessmen and doctors. I’m talking Saudi Princes and Heirs to Dynasty families. The level of comfort and technology these people have come to expect is things we cannot imagine.“What do you mean there isn’t there access to intercoms next to the bathroom for when I need services while going potty?” “The television inside the shower is only a 40 inch and there is no gold in this room I need a better suite”. “I’m gonna need you to go out, buy me better bedding, remake my bed, and then do it again tomorrow because I won’t sleep on the same bedding twice”.And that’s just the tip of the icebergs. - SpaceCatMatingCall</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169982.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I spent 10 years in the boutique and 5 star hotel world. Got stories for days. But here is my favorite that sums up hospitality (former anyways).Our concierge was Les Clefs Dor, had all the connections, this dude could get you into the French Laundry same day. He would often greet guests with sangria and sprigs of mint from his garden. Sometimes he had lemon slices from his tree too! He loved to tell guests all about his garden and they ate it up.Yeah thats all bullshit. Mint, lemon, and any other garnish we got from the local grocery store. The sangria? Cheapest boxed stuff we could find. But he sold the story like no other. At the end of the day, it worked. - Duwinayo</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169983.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Used to work in one two summers ago in a remote-ish place where we lived in accommodations across the street from the hotel. A lot of us have slept with each other (not me, had a gf at the time). And the busiest days are weekends, so we usually have Mondays off. Sundays were called Sunday Funday, where we would go to town or other peoples dorms, and do way too much coke. - Yunagi</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169984.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Heres one taken from the opposite end. Im really bad at rolling joints. I left the shitty joint with my stash and papers on the dresser. I come back to a nicely rolled joint. I dont know if any was missing . But thank you Hard Rock LV staff. - J_Beyonder</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169985.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I am a subcontractor that works in the It business and the W hotel in Miami beach has seen some shit. One day I come in to work and there is a big scramble at the upper floors( that is were the penthouse are) Seems this kinda known millionaire, had a little too much coke and god knows what else and was destroying the room. He was actually throwing furniture out the balcony, ripped everything out of the fridge, might of even thrown a mattress out the balcony. It was a big deal at the time but they keep it hush with no police involved, a guy that’s paying 9k-13k a night is not going to be arrested. When the team finally got into the room, there was cocaine all over the tables, bottles everywhere, and a couple of high class call girls that were in true fear. Next day they book the same room to Jennifer Lopez. - vamptholem</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169986.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I worked at a Ritz Carlton a few years back, its literally the same as anywhere else. The hotel staff is amazing at their job, but on their personal time theyre just as fucked as everyone else.The kitchen staff had a few folks with drug issues and had to be sent home a couple times because of it. In my time there I saw 2 waiters get fired due to embezzlement. The turnover rate for management was very high because they didnt pay enough for the area. The staff parties were WILD to say the least.We werent allowed to greet celebrities by name since they wanted to be anonymous, so we would use their alias that day. Some were greeted by prostitutes or escorts who were always super nice to everyone. A regular would rent out a room for a day, once a month, and make 30-40k that day from clients. Celebrities, business guys, you name it. Crazy. - Mubly</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169987.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. My SO worked for a fancy hotel. The building owners (not the chain, the actual building itself) came to visit. He was on the Forbes billionaire list.He was a nice man who had buffet lunches everyday and tipped every staff members he saw a crisp $100, every time he saw them.House keeper walking past? $100. Bar tender setting up? $100Shift swap? 100 on the way in and out. - paperconservation101</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169989.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Worked at the high end restaurant at a ski resort that hosts a famous film festival.Lots of sex in the walk in coolers, but never the people youd want to walk in on. - johnnycakeAK</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169991.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Never trust glass in rooms. GRAs are so stretched thin on time that they will clean the glasses with the same rags they clean the bathroom, after all their goal is to make the room look clean.I worked as a GRA in a five diamond for years and there was over a year period that went by where we didn’t get a clean glass delivery. We didn’t have dishwashers in the room, so management was complicit. This was in a five diamond, one of the top resorts in the world. Never trust glass in hotel rooms. - WitcherOfWallStreet</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169992.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Didn’t work at one, but delivered newspapers to one.The prostitution thing was something the desk saw a lot. The best one was when the gentlemen got robbed by two young ladies and immediately demanded the front desk call the cops. When the desk asked if he wanted to call the cops and tell them he hired two hookers (illegal)... he suddenly just grunted and marched up to his room. - Who_dat_22</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169993.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. At a certain Beverly Hills hotel, where I valet’d for a short amount of time, many stars cars are just left there. They come and get them whenever. There was also a code name for Justin Bieber who visited often (I can’t remember it). He picked it himself. His G-Wagon and a Bentley were just kept down there free of charge. Usher also left his bike there a few years back and has just never collected it. - Oddwrld</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169995.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Dead people. In some places theres a reasonable chance somebody has died in your bed. Obviously it varies with the type of hotel and its clientele, but some places you get deaths weekly (not that the hotel is unsafe but unfit old people over exerting themselves). One place I worked maybe 40% of the beds had been died in.Bedbugs. They happen in every hotel. You might be paying $5k a night but your luggage was in the hold with everyone elses. If theres only one or two bugs and none in the adjacent rooms (diamond style, so above, below, and both sides) then you brought them in.You know what I never saw happen? Maids stealing. Everyone always points at the maids when they lose stuff but we always found it. No way the maids are risking their jobs over your used iPad or mall jewelry. With tips they make pretty decent money. - KaneMomona</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169996.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. I worked at a 5 star hotel in England as a bartender. Hosted events and stuff. One thing that was common was my manager would just spam extra drinks onto the bill at events to make more money. Or for example if a big wedding ordered 50 bottles of champagne, they’d only give them 30 and would keep 20 back and if they ran out, they’d have to buy more. I reported this to Senior management and they just laughed saying it’s normal. I actually got told off for not taking part in this. - datguywilld</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169998.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. What goes on the room next to you. This week we to evict and have arrested a couple for causing over $15K in damages to a room. This was done quietly late at night and the nearby rooms never found out. - counterslave</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87169999.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. We don’t bat an eye at prostitution or whatever goes on in the rooms as long as it doesn’t affect other guests. Half the women that come to the bar are working girls looking for a sale. The only thing that the hotel industry ever really reports is human trafficking. There are tell tale signs and if something doesn’t add up we do report it to local authorities.I don’t know about all 5* hotels but I’m sure this happens at most of them. Front desk/reservation staff will basically stalk you online if you’re a notable VIP and your picture will be shared internally to ensure everyone recognizes you so you feel special when you arrive and everyone already knows who you are. - NaniBakaNani</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170000.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. I was a valet in college at a very swanky resort. The members had a certain sticker on their car and the owners/partners have a black sticker (which I had no clue) but knew they belonged. When a guy pulled up in a very nice Benz I said, “welcome back (not knowing his name). He was so pissed that I didn’t know who he was, he was an ass to me but I couldn’t care less. Moments later another younger guy pulled up to valet and asked me what the guy said to me. I hesitantly said he was mad I had no idea who he was. The young guy (looked disappointed) and said “that’s my father and he is an a$$hole, don’t worry about him at all.” Then he gave me $20 to park his car and was extremely nice to every employee who ever interacted with him. - batmanlovespizza</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170001.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. I use to work events at hotels and one time we had a guest break their wine glass inside a water refill barrel ... I left work for two weeks to go on vacation and when I came back, all the glass was still piled inside the water refill barrel. People must have been drinking out of it because there were events booked while I was gone - damien_gray</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170003.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. LOTS of prostitution and all the drama/legal trouble that goes along with it. Corporate functions like conventions, parties, etc where theres an open bar almost always leads to something fucked up happening. One hotel I worked at hosted a Christmas party for an investment firm and two guys started jockeying for the affections of a female coworker. They all wound up on an elevator together and the guys started fighting, the elevator went in to safety lock down, we had to call the PD and the FD. One guy went in a squad car, one guy went in an ambulance, we had to give the woman some clothes from lost & found because he dress was covered in blood and the elevator was out of service for six hours to clean it up. Theres always a ton of back of house drama, too. Especially among the execs and the junior managers. Affairs, backstabbing, a little light fraud. You know, the usual. - weirdoldhobo1978</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170004.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. I dont work in one anymore, but used to. This isnt really shenanigans, but: the staff is not nearly so impressed by famous or rich people as some of them seemed to think we should be. It was a fancy hotel. We had rich and famous guests all the time. And it was usually the ones nowhere near the top of the ladder who tried to be the most imperious and expected the most deference. If you have to try to convince us youre high status, you arent. Wed provide polite, professional service for all our guests and try to be helpful and accommodating, but being a C-list actor or whatever isnt going to get you a table in a full restaurant or an upgrade to the already-occupied fancier suites. And if theres a severe blizzard and the airport is closed, we cant open it for you because youre too special to have to wait to fly out. Even if youre a Very Important Businessman. - FranzLuciferdinand</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170005.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
