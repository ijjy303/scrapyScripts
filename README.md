## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">38 of the Most Soul-Crushing Things People Have Ever Heard</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. My husband and I took our teenage son and his friend (I’ll call him Alex) to an amusement park recently.

My husband is a really funny guy and was making both boys laugh on the car ride home.

Alex told my husband, “You’re really funny, Mr. D! You remind me of my Dad, except your jokes aren’t hurtful.”

My heart.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220880.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I used to work in a restaurant, and a woman came in with an urn and set it on her table. Apparently her son had died in a car accident very recently and she was supposed to take him out to lunch for his birthday… so she brought his ashes to lunch instead. She was there for a few hours sobbing into her food (we all felt so bad because people kept staring at her as we sat them or walked past her table). Then she ordered his favorite dessert off our menu with special birthday plating, and just let it sit on the table. It was really awful to watch her be so irreparably heartbroken.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220882.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. When I was 14, I overheard my mother, who had already abandoned my sister and was making arrangements for me to go live with a relative, trying to convince her new husband that they should have a baby together.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220884.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. My dad and step mom adopted a baby girl, and my step sister overheard my dad talking about how excited he is to adopt a girl because *he’s never had a daughter*.

Absolutely crushed my step sister, she thought of my dad like her own father. He’s been all she’s known.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220885.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I saw a documentary.... I dont even recall what it was about, but they were focusing on this family in a rural part of eastern Europe or southern Asia. There was a little girl in this family and all she did was work. She couldnt go to school, and she just assisted her mother in doing all the necessary drudgery around the house.

One of the film makers asked the girl what her secret dream was.

She said, To play.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220886.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Woken in the middle of the night to a phone call from an anonymous, kind nurse who said. “I regret to inform you but [your mother] passed away at 11:40pm. She was not alone... I held her hand.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220881.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. My first big break-up. I was crying and said to my mom, I feel like Im hard to love.

She gently replied, Well, you are.

I was the one being abused.

I was a typical teenager. Ive been brutally honest with multiple therapists (at first, on an attempt to get them to see whatever awful person my parents saw) and have been reassured a was a *typical depressed teenager*.

Any abusive behavior from me was reactive abuse (i.e. yelling after Id been pushed and pushed and pushed).

I wasnt the Proper Pastors Kid they wanted.

Ive been married to the same man for 15+ years (got married at 19) so... I found at least one person to love me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220887.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. My family just gave up on me.

-A 10-year-old that just got the news they had been unadopted by their family of the last 5 years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220888.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Vleir is dead.

Vleir was the name of the pony who basically started my entire horse back riding experience, he gave me confidence like never before, he was so kind, so sweet, so gentle, he taught me how to canter, he taught me patience and how to jump. He was the best boy out there.

The last time I saw him was the afternoon of my usual riding lesson, he was sick so he wasnt being used for lessons. He passes away from a heart attack in his pasture that same night.

I remember crying myself to sleep the night my mom told me he was gone. Tearing up while writing this right now.

RIP Vleir sweet boy, I miss you and I regret not saying goodbye before I left to go home.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220892.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

I’ve never seen such a visible heart break and my own heart has never hurt so much for my mom. Thankfully now five years later they’ve worked through it but I don’t think my mom will ever be the same.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220894.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
