In the September 4, 1998, edition of the Amarillo Daily News in Texas, writer Amy Tao made a few predictions about what life may look like in 20 years—most importantly stating that human cloning will be commonplace.

<span style="font-size:4em">28. In 1988, the Los Angeles Times magazine published a special issue predicting what life would be like in 25 years’ time. In some ways, they missed the mark completely:

Barcodes on our money to avoid corruption and crime and keep track of every dollar bill and who it belongs to.

Multiple families cram into single-home structures, because theres no housing. The opposite of the housing bubble that floods markets with too many empty homes.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146266.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. 911 Dispatcher. Must multitask, and the job involves listening to very stressful and emotional situations, while maintaining calm, but not able to help directly.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Certified Nursing Assistant. They do so much dirty work, work extremely hard, and work just as strange hours as nurses. They should make way more money. -u/jeff_the_nurse</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145725.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Social workers.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Dishwashers. Its a behind-the-scenes occupation that is very underpaid. No special skill is required to become a dishwasher but clean and sanitary dishes are a must for any food service business. Considering that the safety of the public is at stake, dishwashers have a huge responsibility and hence deserve more pay. -u/SuvenPan</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145734.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Line cooks. Especially in high-end restaurants, generally a couple of bucks above minimum wage (at best) and grueling labor while servers are walking away with $800+ a night. Source: worked as a cook in high-end kitchens, many hire undocumented workers for the simple fact that they generally don’t ask for more. -u/qmzx</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145727.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Substitute teachers. Many places pay 80 dollars a day, assume a 7.5 hour day and you have 11 dollars per hour...The only perk of the position is the incredibly flexible hours. -u/willthesane</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145731.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Housekeeping. The minimum wage isnt enough to scrub literal sh*t off the toilet after someone had a diarrhea explosion. -u/cerin2001</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145733.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Delivery drivers.

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Journalists. Real, quality journalists. People have generally no idea how meager their salary often is. -u/funkemard</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145738.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Public accounting. Working 65-80 hours during busy season and not even getting paid for working overtime. That’s why there is a huge turnover in public accounting. -u/kenshin-x-212</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145739.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Any job where you destroy your body; sh*t is no f*cking joke. -u/hunkachunk88888</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145740.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Any jobs that have to do with kids. Teachers, daycare providers, etc. Most people dont realize how much effort it actually takes to be able to do those things. -u/-caballero</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145741.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. I have a BS in Biology, been a vet tech for 5 years. I just broke over $20/hr this year. Full time at my clinic is 36 hours and were discouraged from overtime. Im full-time there and recently started working part-time at an emergency vet in the area to make ends meet. Its insane that we make so little. -u/the_bean_fiend</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145742.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. I work as a school janitor. Im 3 weeks in and Ive already seen some absolutely bananas sh*t. -u/makoexplosion</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145743.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Almost all of them. Seriously, without any hyperbole at all. Almost every single job deserves to be paid more. Except management. Management is not harder. It doesnt take more skills - just different ones. It usually does nothing to add value that a production or office worker doesnt do. Management doesnt deserve greater pay. Everything else does. -u/MortalTwit</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87145744.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky14" id="linky13">16 Final Thoughts From People Who Saw The Light</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. “Bleeding out after Tonsillectomy scars came off. As I was lying in the ambulance on the way to the hospital my thoughts were of my then-fiancee, saying her name three times and telling myself to hang on for her.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146115.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “When I almost drowned while scuba diving, oddly enough, my most prominent thought while in utter panic was also WHAT THE F**K?! I wouldn’t have guessed it but now I think maybe it is the most popular reaction when almost dying unexpectedly lol..”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146116.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “Mine was that in the moment I thought I knew I was going to die, that ..nothing really mattered aside from my kids being taken care of. Debt, owed and owing, things I hadnt done, places I hadnt seen, none of that mattered. For that short time, it was an incredibly freeing experience, until I realized I was going to make it. Then it also slowly crept back in, the stress, the weight of it all. But I learned at that point, that really, very little in life actually matters, in a good way.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146117.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “I thought I had more time…to tell people I loved and appreciated them. That is no longer going to be my last thought – proud to say.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146118.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “I had the most fleeting thought that it would be sad for my parents for me to die on Christmas.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146119.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “I think this water is too deep”. I was 7 or 8 and was walking in the bay and didn’t know how to swim. Walked to a spot where it was over my head and everything went black. I woke up to a lifeguard performing CPR.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146120.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “Where is he.” For context, I was in the hospital and my husband was rushing to get there but he didn’t make it in time. I was rushed to surgery and he was there when I woke up thankfully”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146121.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. “I told my wife “I love you” and then the doctor asked me if I took a whole or just a baby aspirin and I said “tell her I love her” and fell over dead. 12 minutes later they got my heart beating. 19 days later when I woke up, my wife was right there holding my hand.”,</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146122.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “I recently fell twenty-three feet onto rocks. I was climbing a lighthouse built in the 1700s and was being a little more reckless than I should have when I decided to climb the staircase leading to the top. The stairs could support my weight, but the roof collapsed, dropping me down and collapsing on top of me. As the stairs detached from the ceiling, my “last” thought was “well this is a stupid f**king way to die.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146123.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “Of course, this would f**king happen.” Choking on lots of blood after a vein in my throat was cut and burst after surgery. They were panicking because no surgeons were there to seal it.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146124.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “No last thoughts. Last thing I remember is sitting on the couch watching Friday with my brother and laughing my ass off. Then I had a stroke and woke up a week later in the ICU. Wouldn’t have been a bad way to go out, actually.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146125.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “I was having a heart issue/medication complication which I would find out at the hospital later. I could feel my heart pounding out of my chest but I kept getting weaker and weaker. I fell to my knees and pulled out my phone to dial 911. I kept thinking “is this really happening? F**k, this is really happening.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146126.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “A streetlight fell on the roof of my car after I skidded off an exit ramp and hit it head-on. I didn’t realize that they are intentionally constructed to be lightweight and hollow for instances such as this – I don’t run into lampposts much. My thought as I saw it slowly tilt forward until it came down on my car was literally “Well, I guess I’m going to die”. Then I just waited to for it happen. I didn’t have much time to process anything else. I was relieved when it merely dented my roof and unceremoniously rolled off my car and landed in the grass beside me.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146127.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “I was on a commercial jet that caught fire during takeoff. The cabin filled with smoke, the pilot didn’t say a word, and the plane suddenly pitched forward as if we were going to nosedive in. I was weirdly calm and just thought “Wow, I’m going to find out what it’s like to die in an airplane crash.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146128.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. “Oh this is gonna f**king suck” as a car missed me by inches.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146129.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. “I have a calculus exam in four hours, I should be sleeping” while my body shut down from hypothermia.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87146130.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
