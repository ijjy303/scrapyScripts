## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">19 People Who Used the Dark Web Reveal What They Saw</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. To bypass the censors in a country I was visiting, then I realized VPN is faster.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224735.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. About 10 years ago a friend of mine used it to buy 4 grams of cocaine. Cost him about 5 Bitcoins. Bitcoins were worth about $50 at the time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224736.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. To download Internet explorer again.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224737.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Every-once in a while I like to browse the dark market places for entertainment. They offer everything from drugs in small or massive quantities, firearms, fake documents, pirated software. I would never and have never actually bought anything, I just find it weirdly interesting, but its really time consuming to find the right URL, make and account, etc. so its not something I do often.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224738.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Looking up the text of statutes which, as a deeply law-abiding person, I would never violate.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224739.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. There are some other interesting things on these market places. Its not all super dark. But I did see human skulls for sale. But there are legal ways to buy those too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224740.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I watched a friend of mine make a drug purchase. There are market place onion sites for such things. Idk if this is overkill, but he uses a VPN. And he purchases from a secure Linux distro running on a virtual machine. Ofc in the end you always have to give your address to a stranger. The exchange is done with a handshake involving asymmetric encryption. The market place tries to mitigate FBI bait with user reviews. He tries to buy from the same sellers each time if he can. Still feels risky to me, but its definitely still alive.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224741.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I looked at the dark web. Found what was probrably a fake sales website but a very real website talking about selling illegal guns and the same thing with drugs. Again, probs not real but thats what I saw.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224742.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Raw Opium from Pakistan a few years back. Grapefruit size ball for ~$50. Came in a tagine pot.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224743.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. To watch dark youtube, the sick and twisted version of youtube where smosh is still #1.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224745.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I used TOR once because I thought maybe mushrooms would help my depression and that seemed like maybe a much better option vs trying to find them locally. 3/4 of the links on the hidden wiki were dead and those that werent, looked like they were going to infect my PC/Network the second I clicked on anything.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224746.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I recently installed a dark web in the trunk of my car. Helps immensely with the groceries, stops them from shifting around as I drive home. Although Amazon called it a cargo net for some reason, dunno why.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224747.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. I used to buy acid. I have no issue talking about it as it was about 8 years ago. Havent used the dark web since.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224748.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. To rebroadcast baseball games without the express written consent of the Commissioner of Major League Baseball. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224749.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. To find out if somebody is selling my company’s or its employees information there. I work in cyber security.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224750.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. The dark web is just filled with scam or bait drug sites by the FBI, its pretty boring honestly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224751.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. To watch specific YouTube videos about how to fix a door hinge or how to stop a smoke alarm from beeping or whatever, without the algorithm thinking Im just super into door hinges and smoke alarms forever.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224752.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Part of my job! I am a Solutions Engineer for a Cyber Threat Intelligence service provider so I spend a good amount of time doing manual threat hunting in a lot of common dark web sources using Kali Linux VM and a lot of other tools besides TOR for looking up things like compromised credentials, data leakage, IOA (Indicators of Attack), chatter and even getting into IRCs and other covert communication platforms. I also do basic red-teaming tasks like open port scanning (NMAPing), vuln exploit correlation investigation, general attack surface assessments, etc.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224753.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. The only place where you can buy quality bat meat.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224754.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky11" id="linky10">25 Red Flags To Know Before Accepting A Job</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Having to take an online IQ test before even being considered for an interview.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225005.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. They try to sell you their service during your interview. It was really really bad.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225012.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The CEO/boss/whatever drives a conspicuously expensive car.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225007.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. If its a private/family company, do a Google search for [company name] defendant and [company name] plaintiff. If the company has been sued, or is in the habit of suing others, that can be a red flag - although sometimes there are legit reasons for either. But its something worth paying attention to.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225008.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If the company brings alcohol into the office for end of week sessions on a regular basis. I know they can be fun but its a stupendously bad idea for all kinds of reasons and if leadership hasnt figured that out then Id think twice before joining.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225010.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Open interviews. It tells me that people leave faster than you can bring them in, and with good reason.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225019.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. If when youre visiting the company for the first time and you pass someone in a hallway, do they smile and acknowledge your presence with a nod or maybe a hello, or do they ignore you? Its a small thing but very telling about the workplace culture. Similarly, do people seem healthy and energized or grey-faced and tired?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225011.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. To me it was a, we will start you low and will give you a ton of money later. They never do. Never happens.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225013.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. If the job description has a nondescriptively massive salary range ($25,000-$100,000).</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225015.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Interviewed with a regional vp of a billion dollar company for a sales role. When I asked if the position was a backfill or open due to growth, he stated a backfill. I asked if the person was promoted or moved to a new role, and his response was, “we have had more people quit in 2021 than ever, and it’s because they can’t handle the pressure.” Needless to say, I declined the next step in the hiring process.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225016.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I know people (rightfully) like to hate on HR, but if a company brags about not having an HR department to deal with, expect them to be very disorganized at a minimum.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225017.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Anything that the manager says in the interview that doesn’t line up with the job description.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225014.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. When you don’t get a review until you ask for a raise. Then, all of a sudden, you work is being questioned and you’re being berated.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225018.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Trying to rush a decision out of you once the offer is made.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225020.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I always ask the question, why is this role open? Is it a new role, or am I replacing someone? Why did that person leave? This really helps you seeing their reaction and if they look nervous its because the person who left did it because they were not happy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225021.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. The “sink or swim” technique. It was my first day as a cashier. I got a couple of hours of training, then I was by myself and we were dead. All of a sudden this rush came in and I was asking for help. The manager goes “sink or swim, we’re busy back here, figure it out.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225022.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. If when you are asked to come in for an interview, you are not treated with total respect for your time. For example, if you find yourself waiting for extended periods for an interview because so and so is in a really important meeting. Similarly, if you are not offered at least water and/or coffee if youre in for several interviews. I once interviewed at a place for seven straight hours with no break, no food, not even a glass of water. Fortunately I wasnt offered the job as it was at Michael Milkens firm... before he went to prison.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225009.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Are you here just for the money?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225023.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. A couple old senior partners, lots of young employees and nothing in between. That means there’s no opportunity to move up, they can’t get people to stay, and can’t get lateral transfers. They work young folks for as long as they can, and the young folks leave once they figure out the company sucks.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225024.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. When an employee quits or gets fired from the job and the company doesnt hire anyone new to replace them. It can be hard to tell as a red flag at first, but the temporary workload they added to your own, on top of what was left after the person quit, slowly becomes your new permanent workload, without any changes to your pay or benefits to compensate for the additional tasks. The further out it goes without the position being filled, the larger and more obvious the red flag becomes.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225006.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Everybody is very young in a very old company.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225025.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Competitive pay, but they wont tell you what the pay actually is in the posting or even the interview.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225026.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Asking if I planned to have children in the interview. (I was 19.)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225027.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Asking if you are somebody whos willing to put in the time to make sure deadlines are met/work is done, or if youre the type of person who leaves when the workday is finished?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225028.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. I interviewed once at a very huge organization that had a site in the town I was living in, and these guys were so proud of the new top of the line facilities. When they took me on a tour they pointed out the lovely zen garden area that was made for employees to go “unwind and clear their heads”. The problem with it was this area was positioned directly across from all the higher ups offices. Yeah… no.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225029.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
