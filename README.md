The police will extort money from you if they think they can. Fake police will come up to you and fine you or tell you to follow them to different sites where they will charge you. Children will run up to you and ask if you want to ride their camel very aggressively (they will cut you off with their camel and not let you move forward) tell you its free, and then try to charge you insane amounts of money and call their camel pimp over to deal with you if you dont pay. If you dont get on the camel they will often even get the camel to attack you.

We thought there would be tons of abandoned buildings to look at, creepy places to see, adventure to be had- we were so excited, and we were like six or seven hours away so it sounded like a fun trip. We got there, and there was just... nothing. All of the buildings are gone, the creepiest thing we found was a very-well-taken-care-of cemetery, and the only really abandoned thing to see was the stretch of interstate that had been routed around (which had a little bit of fun graffiti on it back then, but in years since its become just a giant paint stain). We ended up driving to Gettysburg instead and going on some ghost tours, so it was still a fun trip, but there was like... nothing to see in Centralia, at all.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174626.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky6" id="linky5">The Often Overlooked Struggles of Being Overweight </a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Ask Reddit is like the town square of the internet. Its a place for people to get together and have honest and unfiltered conversations about what our lives are really like. And sometimes the topics can get a little real. Like this thread, where people share their experience of living life as a fat person.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/24/030603/87174868/ask-reddit-fat-people1.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Weve all dealt with issues when it comes to our bodies. Are we too big, are we too small? But few of us have had to face problems this head-on, and for that, we feel sympathy. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/24/030422/87174850/ask-reddit-fat-people12.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. If you know, you know. And sure, youre thinking, well I dont treat people like this, I dont judge them by their pants size. Do you? Because if you do, then you are the scum of the Earth. Its a good reminder for many of us of what life is like for people who struggle with their weight. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/24/030427/87174851/ask-reddit-fat-people14.png" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky7" id="linky6">The Most Unprofessional Things Doctors Have Ever Said</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I went to the doctors to get my breasts checked (he basically just held and caressed them in a manner he wouldnt have had a chance to feel anything potentially dangerous) and due to them causing me a lot of physical pain I asked him about my options regarding breast reduction surgery. He got visibly angry and told me to never even think about it, and called them beautiful and tender. He was well in his 50s and I was 18-19. I paid like 50 dollars for master roshi to ignore my health issues and make me find another doctor who actually wanted to help people. -u/bratsbane</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173795.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Had a bad head injury when I was a kid (12 or 13) and saw a bunch doctors trying to figure out what was wrong. Got a little snippy with one of them over something I don’t even remember. Pulled up the medical record years later and she referred to me as a “child of the devil” in her report. Had to make some phone calls to get that “diagnosis” removed from my record. -u/DuckSkrol</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173796.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Had a doctor in the 80s tell my mom my severe life-threatening disease, was not real because theres no real evidence that there is a genetic basis for disease. Despite my genetic disease being well studied.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Unprofessional, but funny. I had taken my 92-year-old mother to a recheck appointment to her PCP. An apparently new medical assistant was dutifully getting her history by reading off a checklist. When she asked when Moms last period was, I looked at Mom a little nervously. She was VERY old school, very dignified and would typically never acknowledge to her sons that she had female parts.

I saw a rare twinkle in Moms eyes as she calmly replied, well, I cant give you an exact number of months, but Im pretty sure it was sometime in the late 1960s. The assistant had the good grace to laugh with us, apologize, then read the next question.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. When I was in junior high, I went out for the basketball team. I had to take a physical and it had to be done by the schools doctor and not my own. I went in to do the physical and had to get naked. I did so and the doctor looked me over. He saw that I have an inverted breast bone and said Wow. That is freakish. You cant be on the team with that. I know that my breast bone makes it look like I have a hole in my chest, but I had never been self-conscious about it until that moment.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Because this examination was taking place in the boys locker room in front of other kids wanting to go out for the team too, everyone started laughing at me and calling me names. I grabbed my sh*t and left. My mother took me to our regular doctor who reassured me that there was nothing wrong with me and that there are plenty of people who have breast bones just like mine. It didnt help but I appreciated that she explained it to me. I stopped taking off my shirt in front of others. I was harassed and bullied by my entire classic for years to come because a doctor made a comment that he shouldnt have made. -u/jimmypfromthe5thgala</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173808.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8.

I ended up getting rushed into resuscitation a few weeks later with a punctured lung that caused a one-way valve in my lung where air could escape into my chest cavity but not get back out. Because it was brushed off/not properly investigated it caused a life-threatening condition called Tension Pneumothorax where the pressure that had built up over time on one side of my chest caused my lung to collapse completely and started crushing my heart and other lung, and compressing/bending the arteries, veins, and esophagus in my neck.

After an MRI he realized I had a SLAP tear in my shoulder, so I said, looks like its not all in my head, and he looked at me with such contempt, I never went back to that a**hole. -u/feral_philosopher</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173814.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">Guy Buys The Wrong Dress For GF's 30th, Will Never Live it Down</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. And if you couldnt have guessed on your own, the sub is full of insane people getting worked up over some pretty trivial stuff. No really, it was hard to find an item that wasnt just, my in-laws are poor. Or my husbands parents want to name our kid, Bradny. Now eneter this poor woman, who for her 30th birthday wanted a Kimono from her boyfriend, who we should acknowledge is a white guy. Ohh not looking good for her already. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/24/020256/87174822/dress1.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. So when she asked for a present (someone women shouldnt do, they should just pick them out and have their bfs buy them) she patiently waited for her gift. Only he got the wrong type of dress. Which wouldnt have been the end of the world, but he didnt just get the wrong dress, he got one from a different culture entierlty. A point that clearly was beyond his scope of understanding. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/24/020321/87174823/dress2.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. And we do get her gripe. He messed up. Thats on him, but lets be real here for a second. Her first mistake was expecting Bob ( we assume thats his name) to read her mind. And her second mistake was expecting some bloke from England to know the difference between a Kimono and a Hanbok. We are shocked that shes shocked. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/24/020347/87174824/dress3.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. But then again, if he really is committed to this relationship and one-day plans on moving to Japan with her, wed hope he would have brought his A-game. And on that account, he failed miserably. So no, you are not the a**hole lady, but you are kind of naive for thinking men can be trusted to do birthday shopping unaccompanied. We hope this was a learning experience for both of them. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/24/020409/87174825/dress4.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

I told them that I was but it was a big pay cut and I understood if they left and would be happy to write them a letter of recommendation.


They all stayed. I was an under an NDA that precluded me from telling them that there were about 5 of us out of the 50 that all kept our previous pay rate. They obviously assumed that I was taking a pay cut with them by staying. Im pretty sure that NDA wouldnt hold up in court, but I didnt know that at the time.
