<span style="font-size:4em">3. “Masters of the Universe”. It was back in the 80’s. My crazy, over-the-top, religious aunt said,” it’s satanic!

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Rocks. I’m a rock hound and collect rocks, gems, and stones. The link between crystals and spirituality has gotten me called a devil worshipper…for liking rocks.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. My dad wouldnt let me watch anything that had magic or monsters because he thought it would let demons into the house…The most ridiculous one was not letting me watch Jessie on the Disney Channel.

<span style="font-size:4em">8. So many things, but this one’s my favorite. Ready? Paleontologists.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Back in the 90s, my family had a home pc. We didnt have much so this computer was a big deal to my brothers and me. For school work and some good ole fashioned DOS games. My dad managed to figure out how to get a screen saver with sound onto the computer and was quite proud of himself too. He failed to mention this screensaver to my mother who is VERY religious.So one day I am sitting in high school and got called to the principals office mid 2nd period. Now I am a darn near straight-A student, who didnt get in trouble ever. So this isnt something that has ever happened to me. I get to the office, and I was told my mother called and was very very distraught and I needed to head home to be with her. I hear the secretary telling another office staff that she was losing her mind and a few variations to that effect. I rush home to find the pastor from church, performing an exorcism on our computer. My mother praying fervently through gasping sobs. The pastor and my mother prayed for some time before my dad came home. My dad gets home mad he was called home then he just starts laughing hysterically. Calls my mom a few variations of dumb, goes and wiggles the mouse to bring the computer up and plays the Darth Vader screen saver he added to the computer. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment you make yourself more my servant “I find your lack of faith disturbing.” You underestimate the power of the Dark Side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. You know all the come to the Dark Side quotes. With a picture of Darth Vader’s face. Of course, my mother couldnt get the computer to do it again because she kept messing with it, and it never went back to sleep mode. So of course her first thought was we had an evil satanic computer possessed by the devil himself. The pastor just quietly snuck out with me during my dads laughing and my moms sobs. -u/Tahitisummer</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153192.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">24 Shocking “Last Thoughts” From People Who Nearly Died</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I was having a heart issue/medication complication which I would find out at the hospital later. I could feel my heart pounding out of my chest but I kept getting weaker and weaker. I fell to my knees and pulled out my phone to dial 911.I kept thinking “is this really happening? F*ck, this is really happening.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154200.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. No last thoughts. Last thing I remember is sitting on the couch watching Friday with my brother and laughing my ass off. Then I had a stroke, and woke up a week later in the ICU. Wouldnt have been a bad way to go out, actually.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154201.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. A streetlight fell on the roof of my car after I skidded off an exit ramp and hit it head-on. I didn’t realize that they are intentionally constructed to be lightweight and hollow for instances such as this - I don’t run into lampposts much. My thought as I saw it slowly tilt forward until it came down on my car was literally “Well, I guess I’m going to die”. Then I just waited to for it happen. I didn’t have much time to process anything else. I was relieved when it merely dented my roof and unceremoniously rolled off my car and landed in the grass beside me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154202.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I was on a commercial jet that caught fire during takeoff. The cabin filled with smoke, the pilot didnt say a word, and the plane suddenly pitched forward as if we were going to nosedive in. I was weirdly calm and just thought Wow, Im going to find out what its like to die in an airplane crash.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154203.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I have a calculus exam in four hours, I should be sleeping while my body shut down from hypothermia.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154204.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “Oh this is gonna f*cking suck” as a car missed me by inches</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154205.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. When did the train get so close!!!!Almost got hit by a train.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154206.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Bleeding out after tonsillectomy scars came off. As I was lying in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, my thoughts were of my then-fiancee, saying her name three times and telling myself to hang on for her.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154207.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. I had the most fleeting thought that it would be sad for my parents for me to die on Christmas.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154208.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Mine was that in the moment I thought I knew I was going to die, that ..nothing really mattered aside from my kids being taken care of. Debt, owed and owing, things I hadnt done, places I hadnt seen, none of that mattered. For that short time, it was an incredibly freeing experience, until I realized I was going to make it. Then it also slowly crept back in, the stress, the weight of it all. But I learned at that point, that really, very little in life actually matters, in a good way.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154209.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “Where is he.”For context, I was in the hospital and my husband was rushing to get there but he didn’t make it in time.I was rushed to surgery and he was there when I woke up thankfully</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154210.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I thought I had more time……to tell people I loved and appreciated them. That is no longer going to be my last thought - proud to say.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154211.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “I think this water is too deep”. I was 7 or 8 and was walking in the bay and didn’t know how to swim. Walked to a spot where it was over my head and everything went black. I woke up to a lifeguard performing CPR.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154212.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. I just felt really tired and was confused about why the doctor was yelling at me to look at him and breathe. He was just figuring out that they’d jabbed an artery during my hysterectomy while I was in the recovery unit post-op. Everything just felt cold and my vision was going dark, but that was because of the tremendous amount of blood I’d lost. I didn’t see any bright lights or god, but I also didn’t see any fire and brimstone either.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154213.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I told my wife I love you and then the doctor asked me if I took a whole or just a baby aspirin and I said tell her I love her and fell over dead. 12 minutes later they got my heart beating. 19 days later when I woke up, my wife was right there holding my hand.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154214.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Its gonna make me sound like a lunatic, but I just laughed to myself, paramedics said I was laughing when I came back from it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154215.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I recently fell twenty-three feet onto rocks. I was climbing a lighthouse built in the 1700’s and was being a little more reckless than I should have when I decided to climb the staircase leading to the top. The stairs could support my weight, but the roof collapsed, dropping me down and collapsing on top of me. As the stairs detached from the ceiling, my “last” thought was “well this is a stupid f*cking way to die.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154216.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. 40/30 is really low blood pressure</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154217.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. “He’s not going to stop. He’s going to kill me”Was “wrestling” with a guy. We were on LSD. He started to choke me, other people were laughing. I could not breathe in air to speak. And he kept going until I saw stars and blacked out. Never play fought with anyone ever again.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154218.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Im going to die and Im not even going to take the deer with me.They tell you not to swerve when an animal jumps in front of your car and its better to just hit it, but its a really hard thing to follow.As a fun bonus, insurance covers you hitting an animal, as its a moving object, but not the freeway divider you slammed into while avoiding the deer.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154219.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. My last thought when I knew I would live was-One day this will happen, and I wont be able to stop it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154198.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. If this doesnt kill me, its gonna really hurt</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154220.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. God, I hope he remembers to feed the dog.Was living with my ex at the time and the primary caretaker for his dog.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Nope— not true. Some things leave you permanently changed, and not always for the better.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Youre not married because youre too picky. So Im supposed to settle just so I can be married? You better believe Im going to be picky when it comes to the person Im going to interconnect everything with for the rest of my life. In fact, I know more married people that are in unhappy marriages because they werent picky enough. Better to be single than with the wrong person. -u/CamaroNoir</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154786.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “Never settle. Reach for the stars.” Sometimes knowing your limits is a good thing.

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Never go to bed angry. When youre tired and cranky, thats not the best time to solve your problems. Get some sleep, clear your head, and talk about it in the morning.
