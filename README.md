## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">20 Scientific Facts About Space to Expand Your Mind</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. There are many many mindboggling facts. My favorite one is always cold welding. Due to lack of oxygen - and in consequence lack of corrosion - you can put two pieces of metal together in the vacuum of space, and they will permanently connect, forming a single piece of metal almost instantly. - myhamsterisajerk

 https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vzlxcd/whats_a_fact_about_space_which_will_always_blow/</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224877.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Imagine our entire solar system is the size of a beach ball. And you put that beach ball on a beach on the US east coast. The closest beach ball to us in the galaxy is on a beach in Portugal. We sent a probe out decades ago and as far as we know, it has only just recently reached the edge of our own beach ball. - seamustheseagull</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224878.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Space Fabric. Imagine somehow being able to build a spacecraft which can resist any kind of gravity and other critical conditions, then fly inside black hole just beyond event horizon for a split second and fly back, after exit our galaxy likely doesnt exist anymore even from your PoV it was just there few seconds ago and no one knows how many billions of years youve been there from an Earths time perspective. Or one would simply die together with the universe and the black hole the same second they go beyond the event horizon who knows. - ExacoCGI</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224879.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. That there is enough space between the Earth and our Moon to fit in all the other planets. - decitertiember</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224880.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The sheer size of it always blows my mind. Just the observable universe is 93 billion light-years in diameter, and it’s estimated that the actual universe is about 250x times that. - CymroCam</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224881.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The fact that space isnt just the backdrop in which everything occurs. It actually bends in response to gravity. When you see the James Webb pics for example with the gravitational lensing, the light is going straight in thats its doing what light does and taking the shortest path from A to B. However, space is being bent which is why the shortest path is curved. Its wild that its warping around us. - RPC3</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224882.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. that everything in the universe is actually moving through spacetime at the exact same velocity: C, you, me, a rock, and a photon, are all traveling at the same speed. - EvidenceOfReason</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224883.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Space, the Hitchhikers Guide says, is big. Really big. You just wont believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think its a long way down the road to the chemist, but thats just peanuts to space. Listen . . . and so on. - ShiningRayde</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224884.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. The fact that normal matter only equates to around 5% of the universe as we know it...The rest of it - Dark energy and matter is largely unknown. - huskyhoonigan</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224885.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Pretty much everything you look at isn’t even there anymore - Special-Conference41</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224886.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. The boötes void. It has a radius of 165 million light years wide, and contains only 60 galaxies in a space that would be expected to have around 2000 - Butter_Garlic_Naan</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224887.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. That we sent a robot 35 MILLION miles away. That robot took a selfie and sent it back. - JoaneHan</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224888.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. The largest black hole is the size of Jupiter......s orbit around the sun - groovy604</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224889.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. That we really went to the fucking moon. Imagine telling that to someone from 500 years ago. - ipakookapi</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224890.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I wouldnt say fact as its impossible to know for sure but its believed that the universe is expanding outwards in three dimensions faster than the speed of light. Further more, if you some how could travel to the edge, what would happen if you continued past it? Whats outside of the expanding universe? - Singulant</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224891.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. And then you realise 10 billion suns could fit in the largest star - chug-mug</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224892.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Light cannot bend, however objects that have mass can bend the space around them and if light passes through this space then it appears to bend. Buttttt because light travels at a constant speed and if it travels through this bended space it means that light is taking longer to reach its destination, this is impossible as light cannot slow down and is technically not bending, therefore in this bended space time SLOWS down. Blows my mind everytime I think about it. - mister1bollock</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224893.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. That we will never be able to explore all of it. - roguediamond</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224894.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I read somewhere that there is no definite center of the universe because it is expanding infinitely in all directions. Thus any point in the universe is a center - making you the center of the universe. - Common-Transition973</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224895.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. A photon released during a super nova in some far off galaxy could have spent billions of years and traveled across the entire universe just to end up hitting someones butt while they were laying on a beach. - HumpieDouglas</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224896.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Stubhub— the way they handled the pandemic with changing their policies in peak pandemic so people could only recover credit or resell their tickets instead of receiving cash for canceled events was ridiculous. I was forced to hold my Coachella ticket for 2 years, then they decided to refund everyone this year when they realized they would make more money since the ticket prices will surge when the event is back in 2023. Fuck stubhub. - shughes330

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Shaw Academy. Sleazy little fucks. Their lies in advertising, and nearly impossible to cancel a subscription with them. Tried doing a course that was a free 4-week course. The course was free for the first 4 weeks but the way they sold it was that the course itself was 4 weeks and free. They say you can finish a course as fast or long as you want, but I think it caps out at 3 lessons a week making you stay in the program for a few months, paying monthly.

<span style="font-size:4em">
 Trying to cancel is a nightmare. Sifting through pages and pages of are you sure you want to cancel, heres a 5% discount, fill this form out, now this one, and now this one. All to get to a phone number that is only valid to call for a couple hours a day. When you finally get to call.. its an automated message. 10 minutes of a robot telling me it cares about me and wants me to stay. Only to FINALLY press 2 to cancel my subscription. Fuck. Shaw Academy. - AdoptedMexican</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224980.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. EBay. Escaped an abusive relationship, and was changing all my passwords to random combinations. Set it to log out all devices and force the password to be re-entered. It wasnt actually doing that. (I tried from multiple devices so it wasnt a keylogger or anything my abusive ex was doing. I also confirmed if I logged in on other devices, reset password and clicked to log out all devices it was not logging other devices out). Abusive ex was bidding/winning auctions. I called ebay to report the issue. They said it isnt that my account has been hacked/fraud because I know who is doing it. They would do NOTHING. Said I would just have to take the bad feedback and be blacklisted and that I should pick better partners. Didnt matter that they had a major security flaw. All I could do was remove the payment methods from my account so he couldnt pay for his auctions. I will never use them again. - TribalMog</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224981.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Expedia and all the sites they own/control. Which is a LOT of them. Expedia screwed me over in a bad way, and then their Customer Service people insulted me when I tried to call attention to the serious issues. Ultimately, they offered me a gift card as a Take It or Leave It solution to the entire issue. I left it, and went on a crusade to slam them on Twitter. I did it for a long time but got bored. - Darth_Corleone</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224982.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

I obviously cant boycott them if its the only delivery option on an e-commerce website, or if someone/company happens to ship me something via FedEx.

Reason: When I bought my Pixel 3, the first day it was supposed to arrive, I worked from home that day to sign for my package. They never arrived, and on the tracking, wrote that I wasnt home to receive the package.

I was furious, so I spent the next two days working from home, and even did my work in the kitchen, so that I could physically see if any delivery driver actually walks up to my door. 3 straight fucking days in a row, not a single person comes up. Ring doorbell even doesnt show them walking up, but they have THE MOTHER FUCKING AUDACITY to claim I wasnt home 3 straight days in a row.

Just because they LIED 3 times in a row, even after a phone call each day the first two days, the customer service person even told me I probably missed them when I went to the restroom or something -_- Cant even own up to the fucking fact that everybody in their company are a bunch of fucking liars.

So for that reason alone, I pay more for shipping as long as its not FedEx. Ive specifically driven a further distance to get something printed at Staples or Office Depot just so I dont step foot into a FedEx store.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I was boycotting Blockbuster for charging me late fees because they lost the tape I returned in their evening return slot.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Bank of America. Fucked me over for $10 back in 1993 on a mistake they made. Never getting my motherfucking business again. - sea_cricket</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224997.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. State Farm. Thanks to some whistleblowers, they got busted committing fraud against their customers and the federal government after Hurricane Katrina. They told their claims adjusters to classify damage as flood damage, rather than wind damage, so that they could reject the claim and tell customers to file a federal flood insurance claim. - hells_cowbells</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224999.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Multi-level-marketing schemes. They’re shit companies that attract shitty, and sometimes desperate people, and train them on how to profit off of their friends and families. They destroy lives and I refuse to support them. - ClearBlue_Grace</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225000.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Lifetime Fitness. It really pains me to write this, because I really love their gyms. I had a membership at Lifetime on and off through college. I went to a very large university with great amenities, so I didn’t need the membership during the school year. I tried to cancel at the end of one summer. I was at the gym one day and I asked about the cancellation. I was told to come back at a certain time frame the following Wednesday to cancel. I complied. When I showed up the “person doing the cancellations wasn’t there.”

I was told to return the following Wednesday. Surprise, surprise, the person wasn’t there again. I told them I was going to stop the payment through the credit card company. They responded by telling me that they’d take me to collections then. I ended up escalating through their corporate offices to get the membership canceled. They managed to get 2 extra months of fees out of me. After that year of college, I shifted over to LA Fitness and maintained that membership for about 10 years. When I moved away from LA Fitness, I joined the YMCA, where I’ve been for the last 5-6 years. I will always have a gym membership, but I am committed to not joining Lifetime Fitness again until am reimbursed. It’s really a loss for both of us. - IGuessIamYouThen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225002.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
