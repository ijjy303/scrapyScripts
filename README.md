## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">30 Wild and Crazy Things People Put in Their Wills</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. My vindictive grandmother left my aunt $20 as a reminder of the $20 my aunt stole from her once.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202020.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Not a Lawyer, but an aging woman my family knew left her house(large, and in a very affluent neighborhood) and estate to family friends for so long as her cats were alive and taken care of in said house. After they died, the house was to be sold and the remaining estate donated.The weird thing is, its been like 20 years and the cats are still alive.Also, theyve changed color.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202005.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Not a lawyer but my mom put in her will that if she dies under suspicious circumstances that my sister and I won’t be left anything. She watches a lot of true crime.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202006.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Saw this answer from a similar question some time ago. When a dad died he set up financial installments so long as his daughter remains under a certain weight. Dude was controlling her diet from the grave.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202007.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I (early 20s) was forced to write a will due to the health insurance i get at work, and, amongst sensible stuff, the in-house lawyer said it was totally okay for this clause to be added:My funeral wishes are that i be buried in a coffin which has been springloaded, such that opening the coffin would cause alarm to future archeologistsThen a bunch of stuff about if this is to costly id be cremated and have my ashes scattered in a specific place.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202008.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Not a lawyer, but I work at a law firm. One client left $100,000.00 to his two cats so they could maintain their current lifestyle.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202009.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. When my grandfather passed his will asked that I clean out his shed, and I alone.I found marijuana seeds, old reel style film pornography, which was hilarious and a bunch of other unsavory paraphernalia. 50s flick knives too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202010.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Just last week I handled a matter where the parents left millions in artwork to various people, wads of cash to various charities, and only left their kids the family cats. Turns out they did it because the kids got them the cats to comfort the parents in their old age and the parents f*****g hated the cats but the kids wouldn’t let them get rid of the cats.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202011.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. I work in probate. The oddest thing I’ve seen in a will is to euthanize their beloved horse, have it cremated and it’s ashes scattered with the decedent. Lucky for her horse, she named a horse that was already dead so the one she got afterwards lived to see another farm.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202012.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. A furby collection from models collected in the late 90’s. They were convinced they would retain future value.This was 2011.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202013.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Lots of people sending their friends and family on weird errands to spread their ashes (leaving money for people to take trips and spread their ashes around the world).Pet trusts are a fun one: leaving a whole whack of money in a trust to be used for the care of the pet during their life.However, my favourite ever (that I obviously didn’t draft) was a lawyer who left the bulk of his estate (millions in today’s dollars) to whatever Toronto-area woman had the most children at a specific date some years in the future. I recall the winner had 10.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202014.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. My own grandmother specified which of the children and grandchildren should get which of the family recipes, and somehow felt the need to include commentary about why certain decisions were made. One recipe was this Prohibition era recipe for beer which I knew my uncle, also a home brewer, wanted, but she left it to me, with the comment that I know you wanted it, Teddy, but she has the second-best penmanship of the girls and will make you a copy.And then like eight pages later, in among the specific descriptions of her vast collection of romance novels (really,) was a line: And [specific Jude Devereaux title] to Spidey, who will please subtract about half the hops before she copies the beer recipe for her Uncle Teddy so that any of us can drink it. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202015.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">Our Jon had his IPA last summer and just about died.Uncle Jon just about burst into tears laughing and Uncle Teddy had long since left the room because he has no f***s whatsoever to give about romance novels. Uncle Jon, of course, was still in the room because there was also still Yuengling.And no, I have no idea how she got this will done. My guess is she wrote it herself and the law students who come to her independent-living building signed off on it. It was...elaborate, thats for sure. Total value of the estate was well under eight thousand dollars, so it was mostly a funny last letter from Grandma.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202016.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. No, maam, in order to bequeath something, you actually have to own it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202017.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. I am a qualified solicitor, my favourite two are:1. A lady wanted to create a trust fund of £100,000, for her pet fish. When I asked if it was a special kind of fish, she confirmed it was just a normal goldfish but she wanted it to be fed fresh avocado every day and be looked after by a local dog walker after she died. She was absolutely serious.2. Another lady confessed she had a secret daughter, and she wanted to leave the daughter some money and photographs without the rest of her family finding out. Even her husband does not know. That will be a fun conversation when she passes away.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202018.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I had the first son so my dad decided to leave me more. Except he did the math wrong and it came out to 105%. He had dementia.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202019.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. My sister’s mother in-law is leaving her house to her three sons. If one wants to sell out his third of the house, he has to sell it to the other two brothers for $1.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202021.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Might be late to the party and not a lawyer, but my great-grandad had a clause in his will that stated something along the lines of, “if any of the beneficiaries decide to dispute the contents of the decedent’s estate, their share becomes $1 and nothing else.”Seemed like a pretty good way to maintain harmony among his survivors.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202022.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Had a very attractive woman with terminal cancer try to get herself stuffed by a taxidermist and given to some rich guy that had been basically a sugar daddy to her for a few months. She said He would give me a million dollar a week allowance as long as it was in an official will that he could see. I sent her to a lawyer who I knew that would do about anything for a buck because I didnt want to end up in the news when she died. That was 2 years ago, no clue what happened to her.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202023.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Lady wanted her small dog to be buried with her. If the dog happened to be alive when the lady passed, she wanted the dog put down and then join her.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202024.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. In my Mums will, which I have seen, she has left me the kitchen table and chairs.She lives on a South Manchester council estate.My brother gets the sideboard.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202025.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Client wanted her ashes spread at the restaurant (on the beach) where she met her husband.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202026.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. i got some rock my grandpa really liked</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202027.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. My grandfather left me $1.00, he had dementia and confused my dad ripping him off with me. He left the rest of the family between $100,000 And a few million each.They all said they felt horrible because they knew the details, but not horrible enough to give up any of their share.The way I see it is it was never my money to begin with, so its not a loss. Im just glad my sister got a hundred thousand,she needed it more than any of the others.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202028.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. When my great grandad died in his will he stated that his coin collection be split equally across his family. There was like 8-9 of us and 3 potato sacks full of coins. So we all gathered round a table and each took one coin each until nothing was left. Among the coins was an Iron Cross, which was quiet odd as the only person on that side of the family that went to war was his dad, and he served with the ANZAC’s in WW1.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202029.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Here’s one from one of my dad’s law partners. He had a lady come in with an itemized list of books and wanted her will to contain all of the books and who will get what based on her choosing. So basically she decides who gets what specific book instead of letting her beneficiaries decide. The truly astonishing thing is how many books and how specific they get. According to dad’s law partner her list is at about 2,000 books to be divided among about 30 people. She is apparently very specific and comes back at least once a year to add all the new books she’s gotten.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202030.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Not a lawyer but my grandpa put in his will a chocolate bar for everyone one of his grand kids. Well I have like 12 cousins and very difficult to track down where a couple of them went. All this estates and money he had in will was at a stand still for months because they couldn’t find my couple cousins. Had to show court we put in effort to hire someone to track them down etc. The lawyer that was helping execute the Will was blown away that this lawyer allowed this and why he wouldn’t highly suggest not to do it. But I’m not complaining cause I got a Toblerone out of the deal!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202031.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. I’m the executor of my grandmother’s will. I also get the house and everything in it and a share of life insurance that’s split three ways between myself, sister, and mom. My mom has always said that all my dad , my grandmothers son-in-law, would like to have is some table. Well in the will there’s like a whole paragraph that states how my dad gets nothing, he doesn’t lay a finger on any thing in the house or any money. How my dad is basically worthless and deserves nothing and how he was a c**p dad and that she begrudgingly has my mom in the will. Thanks grandma I’ll appreciate the awkwardness.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202032.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. My father is heavily involved in my great aunt and uncles lives since their health has begun to decline (both mid 90s with no children), and has seen their will.They have a small fortune (in excess of £1,000,000), and have left it all to a local dogs home.When he asked them about it, my great uncles response was nobody has helped me in life, so I wont be helping anybody either.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202033.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Not a lawyer but I worked with plenty of estates and trust accounts over the years. This particular scenario isnt so much about the will itself being strange, but the circumstances that led up to the trust account being opened:I used to work at a bank in the estates department. I was an administrator who had to manage the files including encroachments upon the capital (i.e. I want to take some money out now, please).I had this one account - multi-million dollar trust for one single beneficiary - the son of the deceased. Whats interesting is that the son killed the parents... with a hammer in grotesque and brutal fashion. He plead insanity.He would call once a year from the penitentiary / mental hospital, requesting $50 for commissary (to buy chips and gum). The call was always strange. He was very polite, very doped up. The quality of the call was always very tinny like he was far away from the phone.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87202034.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. At a Petco, all the Guinea pigs were in a big plexiglass enclosure with a center divider. Boys on one side and girls on the other. An employee decided that all the long haired Guinea pigs should be on one side and short-haired on the other. It took forever to sort them out and all the females were pregnant.

Not a mistake necessarily, but I once witnessed our chief accounting officer (and our only accountant; it was a small company) type in values into two Excel cells, pull out a calculator, add the two numbers together in the calculator, and then type the answer in a third cell. She had apparently been doing this for years, with sheets consisting of thousands of rows. I explained how to use formulas and copy them but she apparently forgot because I saw her doing the same thing again months later.

She was supposed to work one day at each school, unless she was called to a school for an urgent case. She would frequently call the school she was supposed to be at, stating she had an urgent case at another school.

One day at lunch she was talking about what was happening in her favorite soap opera. This was before VCRs, and the show aired long before the school day ended. The principal was sitting at our lunch table. He got up, smiled, and told her, see me when you are done with your lunch. After checking, she hadnt seen more than a few kids per week, for many months. Funny thing is, complaints about her work had gone down in that time. She was a crappy guidance counselor.

If we encounter poison ivy, we either stop what we are doing or go get full suit protection with respirators. These dumbasses were weed-whacking in the thickest poison ivy I had ever seen. No protective suit or glasses or respirator. I roll up and notice what the hell theyre doing and point out all the poison ivy everywhere- they were aerosolizing the oil. They both ended up in the hospital on steroids to prevent their death because of the oils they inhaled.

 He claimed it was fine cause he was only gonna touch one wire at a time. The lead electrician respectfully requested said intern be removed from his sight before turning himself into carbon and paperwork. I agreed with this sentiment and had an intern watching OSHA videos for almost 3 days straight as punishment.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. I worked in a paint shop and every time a new chemical was introduced to the shop, I would ask about the hazards. They would tell me that it is a green chemical; there are no hazards. Its baby safe they would say. Once when I entered the shop I saw a guy using a new spray. The side of the bucket indicated that it was dangerously poisonous and highly corrosive.

I told him that he should be using a mask and gloves to use that chemical. He said Dont worry, its baby safe. They even have a picture of a baby playing in it. Sure enough it did.
After seeing the image, I yelled at the guy This is the baby. He is not playing, he is not swimming, HES DYING!

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Shut down a critical file server, then lied about it...even after he was presented with the logs that showed it was his user account that initiated the shut down. Its not so much the mistake that he made, but it was when he lied about making the mistake...that was a rookie move.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. New guy was dragging two 8000lb rolls of paper through the warehouse. This is against the rules for good reason, anyway, he drove through a door designed for 1 roll, and drug the top roll through the wall.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. When I was in the Navy, this known dumbass and pathological liar was on armed watch with an M-14 patrolling the topside decks. Literally, all you have to do is walk around for 4 hours with a rifle on your shoulder. This dude came back to the Quarterdeck (main entrance to the ship) WITH NO GUN. He tried to claim it fell off his shoulder and into the water while tying his shoe. How a rifle would fall off your shoulder, pass through your hands that were tying the shoe, and through all three lifelines (like guard rails) is still a mystery. My theory is that he was doing drill team stuff - like tossing it spinning in the air - and lost it that way.

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Worked in a machine shop. One of the lathe operators left the bar of cold-rolled steel he was turning hanging out the back. When he turned the machine on, it literally deformed and turned into a freaking helicopter blade that ripped the back of the machine apart, and eventually flew off at high speed. Luckily no one got hit by it. If so, theyd be dead.

<span style="font-size:4em">15. The office we worked in was shut down due to Covid and the company went 100% remote. A new senior engineer was hired to work directly with our product team and also manage a team of developers. During our company-wide weekly Zoom meeting after he was done presenting for the company he turned his camera off but forgot to put himself on mute. 100+ people heard this man playing Fortnite and talking down about the company to someone else in the background among other things. He only lasted a month.

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Poured sink cleaning solution into the ice cream machine instead of the cream mixture and I had to stop them, they then said: Im sure itll be fine, it was only a little. No that would poison people. I had to clean out the whole machine top to bottom and refill it. I ended up throwing away nearly a whole bucket full of contaminated ice cream mixture. I would also like to add that the containers didnt look anything alike, the sink stuff came in big plastic jugs with screw tops and the ice cream comes in cardboard cartons (like orange juice) that you have to cut open. So I dont know how she could have possibly mixed the two up.

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I worked as a Radiation Protection Tech at a power plant that was re-fueling. My job was to sit outside of a contaminated area and if anyone wanted to take something out of the area (tools, etc.) I had to make sure it didnt have any radioactive particles on it. To do this you wipe the tool with something like a tissue and then hold the tissue up to a machine called a frisker.
