I turn the corner onto the side street and about halfway down there was a young woman. She wasnt doing anything, just staring at the sky. Staring straight up, STRAIGHT up, neck at a 90 degree angle, mouth slightly agape, long black hair hanging. I hesitated but decided that, since nothing weird has ever happened here before, itd be fine. So I went to walk by. I get up next to her, its a narrow road so not a lot of room to maneuver, and pause to look at her.

She hasnt moved or reacted to me, shes just staring away. So I fight my instincts and ask her if shes okay. She doesnt react. I look up to see if shes looking at something but theres nothing there. So now Im thinking theres something medical going on, so I reach out and touch her on the shoulder. She jolts and and looks at me like shes just noticed me. I ask if shes okay and she just stammers and says sorry before hustling down the street the same way I was headed. I decided to smoke a cigarette to let some distance get between me and her, but towards the end of the street, she stops and stares at the sky again. Doesnt move for the whole five minutes it takes for me to finish my cig. I walked down the main street for the next couple nights.” -Post-Alone0</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185775.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

I was walking my dog with a flashlight. Then I heard someone start screaming bloody murder. Flight or fight kicked in; it truly sounded like someone was being stabbed to death for what seemed like forever.

I chose to find out what the hell was going on. What I found instead was beyond anything I expected. He was a 5 year old boy wandering down the road all alone. All he was wearing were light flannel pants and a thin t-shirt. No shoes or hat. And screaming so loudly it echoed through the hills. I dropped my dogs leash and walked up to him slowly; gently and repeatedly telling him that I’m a mom and that he’s going to be ok. I wrapped him into my arms and carried him to a neighbors home to warm him by the fire and call for help.” -BlueRaining</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185777.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Again just a couple of minutes later he drives by but this time stops a hundred or so feet away from us and just sits there.

One night while walking home I heard some rustling in the jungle of trees on the way home. Next thing I know all of the lights went black and all I heard/felt was a loud wooooosh coming right at my head. I screamed like a little girl, ran, and dropped my ipod (it broke).

That being said, one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced, I genuinely have no explanation for. Living in a city I used to drive out 20-30 miles into the country to do some astrophotography. As I’m driving out one night I see this guy walking at the side of the road with no lights, reflectors and a big backpack. Didn’t think much of it other than it being a little odd. 5 miles later, I see the same guy walking again. I haven’t changed directions, turned, and I’ve been doing 50mph. As I drove past he looked and waved at me. I was pretty spooked but I drove on. I must be imagining things. It can’t be the same guy. I get to my field in the middle of nowhere, park up and get the camera out, and turn off all the lights so my eyes adjust to the dark.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. All the deep sea anglerfish you see pictures of with the lil lights hanging over their heads? Theyre all female.

The males are tiny and born with a terribly weak jaw and a massive hunger. They seek out a female, and torn between hungry and horny they bite her.

She then releases an enzyme that fuses the male to her body. She slowly absorbs them into her body with only their lil testicles remaining so she can instantly fertilize her eggs when she wants to.

Some females have rows and rows of lil testicles on their bodies from where they have absorbed multiple males.

<span style="font-size:4em">30. The bearded vulture or bone-eating vulture, is a rare eur-asian vulture that only eats marrow, that looks rusty in color but is in fact white. This rusty color is because they actually paint themselves with red clay deposits to look attractive to their mates. They are really cool looking.

They have a little tuft of feathers below their beaks that looks like the beard of a dragon, so that is why they are called that.

Other cool fact: They can dissolve bone in the acid of their stomach in 24 hours. The PH of their stomachs is 1 which is VERY acidic. They are the only vulture species in the world that 90% of its diet is just bone.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87186387.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">31. The vast majority of Greenland sharks are blind thanks to a special parasite that eats their eyes and replaces them.

It is thought that this might actually be helpful because a) their eyesight was s**t anyway, b) the parasites wave like lures and may have an anglerfish-like effect, and c) the sharks are super slow so that might be one of the few ways for them to catch live prey.
