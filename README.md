<span style="font-size:4em">1. “If you’re in a New York City subway, try not to make too much eye contact or look too long at people around you. Old guy lighting up a crack pipe near the door between cars? Just ignore the smell. Woman near you screaming at the top of her lungs at her silent child? Keep listening to your music. Someone digging through their bag, muttering to themselves, and throwing rose petals on the floor like they’re preparing for a seance? Just keep staring blankly at your phone. Trust me.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180160.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

The tour and short presentation will be way longer (and obnoxiously higher pressure) than youd expect and they know damn well after youve invested a few hours youre not going to leave without the promised reward that they only give you at the very end. These people are most often found at the entrances to malls or casinos at what can be easily mistaken for information booths. Either just say no no matter how long youre actually still going to be there or flat-out ignore them.
