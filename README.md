<span style="font-size:4em">1. While I was working at a mall in Jersey, The Rock was there for a signing, and he was so sweet and kind. Smelled amazing and spoke to everyone there, bought us all lemonade and cinnabons with extra frosting.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164273.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. McCartney in NYC. All I can get out is, “Thank You So Much.” He mimicked me by saying, “You’re So Welcome” with a big grin. I’ll never forget it. You have much lesser names to be snobby and couldn’t care less.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164267.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I worked at a trendy spot in NYC, and we got our fair share of celebrities. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice many of them were, but the best was Paul Rudd. He even stuck around and had a drink with staff members. Absolutely delightful.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164268.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Cousin and I saw him at the hoagie shop. Stood out because of his height and his very nice leather jacket. My cousin and I were awestruck and the person he was with noticed us, chuckled, tapped Bernie Mac who then turned around and said, “What do you all want? It’s on me.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164269.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The man literally got in my mom’s minivan and asked to take a picture with me because I was being a lame teenager and didn’t want to get out after my mom stopped in the middle of the street to ask him for a picture.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164270.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Friend’s dad met a “very nice man” at a farm stand in 2011, couldn’t figure out why the guy looked familiar, so he asked him. Guy laughed, asked if he had kids, and when the friend’s dad said yes, the nice guy said “Let’s take a pic and show your kids later, they’ll know.” It was Hugh Jackman.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164271.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. The two times I met him and got to talk to him was so awesome. Told him I was an original kb24 member, and he stopped, and we talked a bit, signed two pairs of my Kobe’s. I can say it’s a great memory I will never forget.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164272.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I used to work at a sporting goods store, and I was sweeping up before closing, Monique walked in and told me to stop sweeping. Then went off on my manager and said, “You got this beautiful black brother in here sweeping floors?!” She even gave me $100.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164274.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Leonardo DiCaprio at Cannes in 2007. Took several pics with a very nervous fan until she was satisfied. On his way to his seat, I extended my hand for a shake, but his bodyguard pushed my hand away. He reached over him and shook my hand anyway.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164275.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I met her at a grocery store. She talked to me for 20 minutes and even talked to my little sister on the phone right there when I asked her. And my sister screamed into the phone like a crazed fan. Ms. Watley is the most gracious celeb I’ve ever met.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164276.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. After a show in Atlanta. At about 1 am, he took a group shot with all of us and then said he would do individual selfies. My phone was dead, so I thought I was going to miss out. He asked to use another friend’s phone, so I could still get a picture with him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164277.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. She told me I was beautiful and was easy to talk to. I was shocked when I got a kiss on the cheek so soon after meeting her. For a model so successful and stunning, it was nice to feel I wasn’t an ugly peasant in her presence.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164279.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14.
