The idea of a fighting withdrawal was perhaps slightly fanciful, and the town held little strategic value, but nevertheless, the battle contributed to the remainder of the German Army in Italy surrendering just four days later. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87134626.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
