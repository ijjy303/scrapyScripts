## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">25 Medical Conditions Way More Serious Than They Look</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohns, Colitis, etc). People here bowel and think Oh, thats just that pooping illness but internal bleeding, intestinal obstructions, massive amounts of pain, ulcers... its not an easy ride even for mild cases.-u/sticks1218</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128421.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Asthma. People stop breathing. Tv and movies like to show it as a way of identifying a weakling, but it is a serious, deadly disease. It is also super not fun.Until my mid-20s I was hospitalized at least 2x a year because my emergency inhaler wasnt enough to make me start breathing again. I bought my own nebulizer, and it is the only reason I havent been hospitalized since.-u/AtheneSchmidt</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128422.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Eczema. People think its just itchy skin but it can be horrendously damaging-u/WitAndSavvy</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128423.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Type 1 diabetes. I generally downplay it to I can just take insulin and can eat whatever I want because its easier than explaining Ill be playing a game of Flappy Bird the rest of my life where if I get the dosage wrong I can die immediately and without warning, where if I dont have insulin for 3 days I die a horrible painful death, and if I ignore it I can go blind and lose the ability to digest food. And all the fucking beeping devices, all day every day. Its beeping at me right now.Oh, and insulin costs $600 a month, so thats cool.-u/CrackSammiches</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128424.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. All the autoimmune diseases. The amount of pain suffered is incomprehensible. The medications can be brutal with side effects, and can cause other issues. The impact on families and the mental health of the patients is almost always negative. Most of the diseases are degenerative, and there is no cure for any of them.-u/mykidsarecrazy</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128425.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Tinnitus. It literally drives people to commit suicide to stop the ringing.-u/beasterne7</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128426.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Deaf/HOH backstory: both sides of my family have back hearing backgrounds. My father is deaf and my moms side just has bad hearing in general. I had good hearing most of my life until I was about 14ish. Discovered I have progressive hearing lose and I’ll eventually go completely deaf. It just sucks cause It’s so hard to communicate and do most things like a normal person and most people don’t understand that. For example when I ask someone to repeat myself and they say “ what are you deaf?” Yeah, I f*cking am.-u/Proper-Type7899</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128427.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. As a narcoleptic: people tend to think its funny/quirky that I will fall asleep randomly but get all serious when Im suddenly lying asleep in the middle of a crossroad.-u/evoli21</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128428.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. ShinglesIt can infect your eye and cause blindness. It can cause such severe pain and debility, you require long term nursing care (nursing home). Shingles is horrible.-u/Secret_Choice7764</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128430.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Anorexia nervosa gets joked about a lot, but the survival rate is actually quite poor.-u/Secret_Choice7764</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128431.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. GERD. Cant count the number of people who say I just get stomachaches sometimes or everyone gets heartburn. I have esophageal scarring and have a restricted diet just so I dont spend days in agony because I decided to drink a sprite. I had a feeding tube attached to my stomach for years because I couldnt swallow and everything irritated my esophagus. My concerns werent taken seriously by doctors and I spent two weeks in a hospital struggling to convince them I wasnt anorexic. Even my voice is affected, I sound raspy to various degrees all the time.-u/PeculiarInsomniac</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128432.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Migraines and cluster headaches. We might look okay on the outside, but its completely debilitating. I lose a lot of my life to head pain, as I mainly work and lay in bed. I have lost touch with a lot of friends and family members due to last-minute cancelation plans. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128420.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Some days, its so bad I want to drill a hole in my head to release the pain. Clusters are worse. This is why Im not a gun owner. It really sucks with this condition; its really not considered a disability. So I have to force myself to work to live, but forcing it makes it worse, so the quality of life really sucks. I have to warn new coworkers that if I start slurring, talking funny, or cant find words, Im not drunk and not having a stroke. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128433.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

I know there are tons of horrible diseases out there, so I try to tell myself it could be worse. It also really sucks when someone tells you to suck it up because its just a headache. Ok, sorry, rant over.-u/turtle-girl420</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128434.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Restless Legs Syndrome. Yes it is real, and yes it disrupts ones life, especially the ability to sleep. Lack of sleep then leads to a whole host of other conditions.-u/Mymoggievan</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128435.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Took my husband from an active, healthy, intelligent man to barely able to get out of bed. Terrible brain fog and many other debilitating symptoms. It is not just being tired.-u/Motor_Relation_5459</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128436.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Hypothyroidism. People think it just makes you fat, but if your thyroid stops working it can wreck your life. So many bodily functions are controlled by your thyroid. Every weird symptom I had for years can be explained by my thyroid going out, from years-long exhaustion to depression to my hair falling out to muscle aches to anemia to shortness of breath to brain fog to intermittent double vision. There are more. Those are just the most prominent ones for me.-u/PetLemur</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128437.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. My friend had an endometriosis case so severe, that it created webbing that was wrapped not only around her uterus and Fallopian tubes, but also was beginning to wrap around her intestines. While it’s incredibly painful on its own, it would get worse when she ate. I may be describing this incorrectly, but the doctors told her as she was digesting her food, it would pull on the “webbing” which caused the cramping to intensify. So did having bowel movements. She was in agony until the surgery to remove it. She lost so much weight because eating caused her so much more pain.-u/SomewhereinOregon</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128438.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Dental abscess. A lot of people dont realize that dental infections can kill you if they spread throughout your body.-u/DeathSpiral321</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128439.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. A nurse in my hometown committed suicide a few months after giving birth. She had been treating her Postpartum Depression the whole time and could never get the correct meds. It was very shocking to a lot of people who didn’t know what she was going through.-u/hawgfan1983</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128440.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Dementia. It’s not just “Haha grandma woke up today and thought somebody stole her purse but she had hidden it,” or “Come on Dad, just look at the picture carefully and you’ll remember it’s your grandchildren and great-grandchildren in it.” There are so many behaviors, they get violent, they elope in the middle of the night or day, they lose their entire identity. They go back into not knowing how to care for themselves. It is extremely heartbreaking to watch the process. Especially with Lewy Body Dementia. They’re getting younger and younger nowadays and they tend to decline at a much faster rate.-u/nollyson</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128441.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Snoring Often a sign of something more serious, like apnea, which can impair cognitive function, cause weight gain, and trim years off your life.-u/BudgetHero</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128442.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. How about OCD. People think it just makes them quirky and particular.

## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">15 Secrets You Should Know If You Like Cooking</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Put a little water in your leftovers before you put it in the microwave and cover it. Especially meat. It doesnt dry out and it actually makes turkey more juicy. - SuperstitiousPigeon5</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129221.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Vanilla pudding mix in chocolate cookie recipe. - ShaniquaStringfellow</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129228.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Air is the secret ingredient in deli-style sandwiches. The same amount of meat, arranged loosely, rather than stacked tightly, not only seems more generous, but actually tastes (or at least smells) better, because more flavonoids reach your nose. - Bellsar_Ringing</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129230.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. If youre measuring anything sticky like molasses or honey for a recipe use a pastry brush to coat the inside of the measuring cup with a small amount of cooking oil first. Reduces sticking on the inside of the measuring cup. - Imaginary-Ticket-805</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129220.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I don’t know if this is a secret, I feel like every one does this, but when a recipe calls for a teaspoon of vanilla extract I add something closer to two tablespoons. The people making the recipes use higher quality vanilla, the cheap stuff at the store is extremely bland compared to the high quality stuff. - Godmorelikedog_666</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129224.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The recipe on the back of the tollhouse chocolate chip bag, follow it to the letter. Everyone thinks I have the best of the best chocolate chip cookies. - CreepyButterscotch3</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129217.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Dont cook a new recipe if you want to impress people. Cook with the same recipe many times until youre confident you can deliver good results, THEN use the recipe. - Cartossin</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129218.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I reduce five pounds of sweet onions down to 2 cups of deeply caramelized onion. 1/4 cup supercharges any savory soup, stew, etc. - Thirty_Helens_Agree</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129219.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. People always say Im a great baker - thing is that if you actually follow recipes to the letter, know if your oven runs a little hot/cold and know what some basic things like hand warm actually mean - its hard to get it wrong. - InternationalLimit40</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129222.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Butter. It’s not a new secret by any means, but I feel like people often forget how amazing even just the tiniest bit added to a dish can be. Some of your favorite restaurant meals probably use way more butter than you’d be comfortable knowing. - AmarettoOrWhat</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129225.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Lots of people forget to add acid. Use acid to make flavors pop. - Zmirzlina</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129226.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Cooking korean food? Get the salted shrimp and the fermented chile paste/soybean paste. Korean barbecue marinade? Blend an onion, an apple, garlic, green onion, and a couple pinches of salt together. That’s your base, then add the seasonings. The meat will be more tender with the puree and give you that extra depth that you might have been lacking from ready-made sauces. When I’m lazy I just add that puree to the jars of ready-made sauces. - notasianjim</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129227.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
