###### 38. Not discussing your income with coworkers. At least in the US, employees are protected, so they are allowed to discuss income amongst each other without fear of getting fired for it. However, a lot of companies have kept the idea that it is taboo or that your job may be at risk for doing so and a lot of people still buy it to this day.Yes, most people that live in the US know that all states (except Montana) are at-will states, meaning that they can fire you for no reason at all, meaning that while technically they wont fire you for discussing pay, some companies will not like it and find any excuse to let you go, so keep that in mind.Also, some companies will try to stop if right off the bat by having it in your employee handbook that you are not to discuss pay, so make sure you check that out in your case. My company actually has the opposite, stating that they will never go after someone for discussing pay, and they even have it posted in public areas. However, Im not naive and understand that while it may seem that way, they can just be doing that to protect themselves, so who knows. Ive been there for a few years now and we have not heard of anyone getting fired for anything that could be even remotely related to pay discussions.The point of my comment was to let people know that the idea of discussing your pay with other employees being a no-no or taboo is an antiquated idea started by greedy companies decades ago to help keep the average worker from demanding better wages that they rightfully should be getting in the first place, and that legally they cant outright fire you simply for doing that (with exceptions, of course). I myself have no issues letting anyone know how much I make if they ask, and if they use that to get themselves properly compensated, then Im happy for them at the end of the day.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87123156.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 39. Someone mentioning diamonds reminds me of chocolate diamonds.What are they in actuality?

## <a href="#33" id="32">30 Ordinary People Who Helped Shape History</a><br>

###### 1. On 28 May 2013 during the Turkish Occupy Gezi protests, the woman in red, Ceyda Sungur, was pepper-sprayed by police, which became the defining photo of the movement. The protests began against the development of Gezi Park in Istanbul but transformed into a national movement against the increasing authoritarianism of the right-wing government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125661.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

 A university worker, Sungur didnt want notoriety, saying a lot of people who were at the park and they were also tear-gassed… There is not (a) difference between them and I. She was subsequently arrested for “provoking people to disobey laws”, although the following year the charges were dismissed.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125637.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 2. On 13 April 1985, Danuta Danielsson, a woman of Polish-Jewish origin whose mother had been put in a concentration camp during the Second World War, hit a neo-nazi of the now defunct Nordic Reich Party on the head with her handbag in Växjö, Sweden. The fascists were subsequently chased out of town.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125638.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 3. On 27 October 1962, at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, second-in-command Vasili Arkhipov of the Soviet submarine B-59 refused to agree with his Captains order to launch nuclear torpedos against US warships and setting off what might well have been a terminal superpower nuclear war. The US had been dropping depth charges near the submarine in an attempt to force it to the surface, unaware it was carrying nuclear arms. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125639.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

The Soviet officers, who had lost radio contact with Moscow, concluded that World War III had begun, and two of the officers agreed to blast the warships out of the water. Arkhipov refused to agree - unanimous consent of three officers was required - and thanks to him, we are here to post about it on the internet!<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125640.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 4. On 29 December 1939, French physician, libertarian socialist, and womens rights activist Madeleine Pelletier died in an asylum where she had been interned after openly assisting an abortion for a teenage survivor of incest. Born into a poor family in 1874, Pelletier became a feminist and socialist and was arrested for breaking a window at a polling place after she and other women were denied entry. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125641.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

While never admitted into intellectual circles, she was a pioneer of advanced feminist ideas, like gender roles being largely determined by society, rather than biology. While expressing no interest in sex in her personal life, and so possibly asexual, Pelletier advocated for womens rights to sexual pleasure, as well as to contraception and abortion. Despite all the misfortune she experienced, Pelletier declared: I remain a feminist. I will remain one until my death even though I dont like women as they are now any more than I like the working class as it is. Slave mentalities revolt me.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125642.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 5. On 2 November 1970, actor and Vietnam GI resistance supporter Jane Fonda was arrested at Cleveland airport as she returned from an event put on by Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) in Canada and charged with drug smuggling. The following day Fonda was also charged with supposedly kicking a police officer when a more famous mugshot was taken as she raised her fist in defiance at the police. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125643.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

Both charges were bogus – the drugs were vitamin tablets – and they were both later dismissed. Although Fonda is clear that the intention was to discredit her due to her valuable support for the GI anti-war movement. In addition to being a patron of VVAW, Fonda was a leading organiser of and participant in the FTA (Fuck The Army) tour, and anti-war alternative to the USO shows to serving GIs.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125644.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 6. On 14 October 1977, anti-gay crusader Anita Bryant was pied in the face by Tom Higgins, a gay rights activist. Bryant, who was already well-known as a singer, led Save Our Children, a homophobic campaigning group that successfully overturned legal protections for LGBT+ people in Dade County, Florida. Bryant had declared about homosexuality: I will lead such a crusade to stop it as this country has not seen before. After being pied, Bryant burst into tears and began praying. Bryant was also a brand ambassador for Florida orange juice, which then became subject to a mass boycott campaign. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125645.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

Gay bars replaced screwdrivers (vodka and orange juice cocktails) with Anita Bryants – made with vodka and apple juice, with the profits donated to the campaign. Bryants lucrative orange contract subsequently lapsed and her marriage failed, which caused her to be ostracised by some Christian fundamentalists who did not approve of her divorce. Later in life, Bryants homophobic views softened, and she stated she was more inclined to say live and let live. In 1998, Dade County reintroduced legal protections for LGBT+ people, and efforts by Christian groups to overturn them failed.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125646.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 7. On 28 November 1919, Faye Schulman, photographer, and Jewish resistance partisan, was born in Lenin, Poland (now Belarus). In 1942, the Nazis murdered 1,850 Jews in the Lenin ghetto, leaving only Faye and 25 others alive, making Schulman take and develop photos of the massacre. Covertly she made copies of the photographs for herself. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125647.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

She soon fled and joined the partisan resistance, serving as a fighter and nurse. While on a raid in Lenin with her unit, Schulman managed to retrieve her camera equipment and then began documenting the resistance movement, developing her photos under blankets. I want people to know that there was resistance. Jews did not go like sheep to the slaughter. I was a photographer. I have pictures. I have proof. Schulman survived the war and moved to Canada, eventually passing away on April 24, 2021, aged 101.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125648.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 8. On 31 May 1927, Fred Trump, the father of US President Donald Trump, was arrested at a rally of the Ku Klux Klan in Queens, New York. He was initially arrested for refusing to disperse along with six other people after the rally descended into disorder. The Long Island Daily Press reported that all seven arrestees were wearing Klan robes. After Donald Trump was endorsed by David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Trump was questioned about his fathers arrest. Donald claimed to journalist Jason Horowitz that it never happened, despite it being reported in several newspapers. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125649.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

When Horowitz asked Trump if the address reported for his father in the newspapers, 175-24 Devonshire Rd, was accurate, Donald dismissed it as totally false. However, Fred Trumps wedding announcement in the Daily Press listed his address at 175-24 Devonshire Rd. Fred Trump was subjected to legal action by the Justice Department on multiple occasions for racist behaviour as a landlord, and one of his former tenants, folk singer Woody Guthrie once wrote in a song mentioning Trump: I suppose / Old Man Trump knows / Just how much / Racial Hate / He stirred up.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125650.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 9. On 13 June 1936, this photograph was taken at a rally for workers launching a new ship in Nazi Germany. The man circled, defiantly folding his arms rather than perform the Nazi salute is believed to be August Landmesser, a shipyard worker who fell in love with a Jewish woman. He was later imprisoned for the relationship and drafted into the army. During his military service he was killed in action, whereas his partner was murdered in the concentration camps.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125651.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 10. On 11 June 1943, Karl Gorath, a 20-year-old gay German nurse, was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. He was first arrested for homosexuality after being denounced by a jealous lover in 1939 and given a prison sentence. After his release, he was sent to the Neuengamme concentration camp, where he was made to wear a pink triangle denoting LGBT+ prisoners. Working in the camps health department, with some comrades he attempted to smuggle food to Russian prisoners, who were being starved to death. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125652.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

Their plan was discovered by the Nazis, who then sentenced Gorath to transportation to Auschwitz as a criminal and political prisoner, to be denoted with a red triangle. Despite contracting dysentery, he managed to survive the war and was released in 1945. But within a few months, he was arrested again by West German authorities, who had kept the homophobic Nazi laws intact. His case was overseen by the same judge, who greeted him with the words You are already here again! and gave him the maximum sentence of five years. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125653.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

His lawyer requested that his time served in the concentration camps be counted as part of this, but his request was denied. After his release, because of his convictions, he was unable to get a job for a decade. And when the time came to draw his pension, his years interned in concentration camps were deducted from his allowance, as were his unemployment payments. He died in 2003, having never received compensation for his treatment, unlike some other Holocaust survivors. He told his story in a 2000 documentary, Paragraph 175, named after the relevant section of the penal code.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125654.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 11. On 4 August 1990, the term Two-Spirit, for Indigenous people who embody diverse (or non-normative) sexualities, genders, gender roles, and/or gender expressions, was adopted at the 3rd Annual Gathering of Native American Gays and Lesbians being held near Beausejour, Manitoba, Canada. Teacher, counselor, administrator, mentor, and elder, Dr. Myra Laramee (First Nations Cree) brought the term to a sharing circle of 80 Indigenous LGBT+ people from across North America at the 1990 Gathering, and it was quickly adopted. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125655.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

As Harlan Pruden, the managing editor of the Two-Spirit Journal, put it: [Two-Spirit evokes] the time before the harshness of colonisation where many, not all, First Peoples had traditions and ways that were non-binary, where some Nations had 3, 4, 5, 6, or even 7+ different genders and these genders were not only accepted and honoured but also had distinct roles within their respective Nations. Today, we would generally refer to these individuals as Two-Spirit.” Pictured: Two-spirit Zuni princess We’wha, New Mexico, c1886.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125656.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 12. On 28 February 1972, the trial of legendary Black communist Angela Davis for murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy began in San Jose, California. The trial resulted from a courtroom shootout in 1970 in which four people were killed. Davis had purchased some of the firearms used in the incident. However, Davis herself was not present, and she declared herself innocent of all charges. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125657.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

By the time the trial had begun, nearly 300 groups had sprung up around the world supporting her and working for her freedom, and John Lennon and Yoko Ono contributed the song Angela to the campaign. Angela Davis had a team of experienced lawyers, but she delivered her opening defence address herself. The defense demolished the prosecutions case, and eventually, on 4 June, the all-white jury came back with not-guilty verdicts on all charges.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125658.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 13. On 8 April 2013, former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher died. Street parties broke out across the UK, particularly in working-class areas and in former mining communities which were ravaged by her policies. Her legacy is best remembered for her destruction of the British workers movement, after the defeat of the miners strike of 1984-5. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125659.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

This enabled the drastic increase of economic inequality and unemployment in the 1980s. Her government also slashed social housing, helping to create the situation today where it is unavailable for most people, and private property prices are mostly unaffordable for the young. Thatcher also complained that children were being cheated of a sound start in life by being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay, so she introduced the vicious section 28 law prohibiting the teaching of homosexuality as acceptable. Abroad, Thatcher was a powerful advocate for racism, advising the Australian foreign minister to beware of Asians, else his country would end up like Fiji, where the Indian migrants have taken over. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125660.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

She hosted apartheid South Africas head of state while denouncing the African National Congress as a typical terrorist organization. Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, responsible for the rape, murder and torture of tens of thousands of people, was a close personal friend. Back in Britain, she protected numerous politicians accused of paedophilia including Sir Peter Hayman, and MPs Peter Morrison and Cyril Smith. She also lobbied for her friend, serial child abuser Jimmy Savile, to be knighted despite being warned about his behavior. Margaret Thatcher was eventually forced to step down after the defeat of her hated poll tax by a mass non-payment campaign. Pictured: Jimmy Savile welcoming Thatcher to hell, reportedly.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125662.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 14. On 25 December 1914, 100,000 troops on the Western Front during World War I held an unofficial truce where they refused to fight one another. German troops began singing Silent Night in German, French, and English, along with other Christmas carols. They decorated the trenches with Christmas trees, lit candles, and hung multilingual banners wishing opposing armies Merry Christmas. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125663.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 

Across much of the front artillery fell silent, British troops joined in the carol singing and both sides began to shout Christmas greetings at one another. On Christmas Day, soldiers began to climb out of the trenches to fraternize with the other side, bring back bodies from no mans land, and exchange gifts like tobacco, chocolate, and alcohol. In several areas, there are first-hand accounts of often-improvised football matches being played. The truce covered about 100,000 men, almost entirely on the Western front however there was also a small truce along part of the Eastern front between Austrian and Russian troops. <br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87125664.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#35" id="34">19 Common Things Most People Don't Use Correctly</a><br>

###### 1. The protective plug with a ring right under the main cap may actually be useful. If you turn the ring down and put it back into the bottle’s neck, it will work like a valve. You can use it to control the amount of oil that pours out of the bottle.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124827.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 2. If you often notice the food in the microwave oven heating unevenly (the edges are hot and the middle is cold), try putting the plate near one of the edges, not in the center. This simple trick will allow you to heat the food more evenly.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124828.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 3. Red plastic cups are usually the star of the holidays. And the lines we see on them are also related to these festivities. They are not part of the design, nor do they serve to grip them better, contrary to what we might believe. These lines are measurements. They indicate the amount to be served according to what you are drinking, the daily amount of juice for kids, and even portions of mouthwash.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023737/87125926/87040576.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 4.  Laundry pods might be completely useless if you put them on top of the laundry. The right way is to put them into the washing machine first and then put the laundry on the top. By the way, if you wash clothes at a low temperature, the shell of the pod might not dissolve in the water completely and it could leave stains.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124830.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 5. There are loops on shopping carts that can be used to hold your grocery bags, keep them upright if they have fragile items, or store extra if you’ve got a lot of groceries.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023412/87125923/86520379.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 6. There are tiny markings on tape measures that are there to help you find the right position for wall studs. These black diamonds are known as “stud finders,” and they can help mark the center point between two studs.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023436/87125925/86520390.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 7. To make the deodorant as effective as possible, you can also use it on your legs, the inside of your thighs, and other body parts that produce a lot of sweat. It’s not just for your armpits!<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124831.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 8.  A TikTok user found an unusual way to solve an old problem — how to put a blanket into a duvet cover. You need to put the blanket and the duvet cover on the bed, match the corners, and make a roll. After that, open the slip, put the blanket inside, and button up the slip.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124832.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 9.  Today, we rarely use the drawer under the oven the way it was meant to be used. It was supposed to be the place where you store the meal you’ve just cooked to keep it warm while the dessert is being cooked in the oven.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124833.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 10. To make the blender work better, you should stick to the right load order. We usually put berries first and then add milk. But in fact, it’s better to do it the other way round.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124834.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 11. If the pillowcase is a bit too big for the pillow, professional cleaners recommend not leaving it hanging loose. They recommend folding it inside, which makes the bed appear neater.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124835.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 12. In the past, Kleenex had a totally different purpose. They were meant as gas mask filters, and then the company started offering them to women to use during their periods. After that, the manufacturer reconsidered the formula, made the product softer, and started selling them as a makeup removal product.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124836.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 13.  Spending a bit of time understanding your plungers can be useful, though, because different plungers are used for different problems. A flat plunger is fine for a sink, but if you need to use one on your toilet you’ll need one with a tapered end.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023423/87125924/86520380.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 14. Everyone has probably argued about how a toilet paper roll should be hung. Now, we have an answer thanks to the 1891 patent received by New York businessman Seth Wheeler.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124837.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 15. There is a thing inside the lid thats designed to get just one piece out. Flip the box, then turn it on its side, and open, there should be one Tik Tac sitting in its place.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023358/87125920/86520355.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 16.  Isnt it annoying when you need to use foil, often the whole roll comes out. There’s a simple solution right there on the box, it even says: “Press Ends To Lock Roll” and that’s exactly what it does. If you look on the sides of the box, you will see the little grips, you just push them in and they hold the roll in place.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023401/87125921/86520363.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 17. That drawer at the bottom of your oven isnt for storing pots, pans, and baking sheets, its actual purpose is to keep your food warm.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023410/87125922/86520367.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 18. To ensure the maximum efficiency of the dishwasher, don’t overload it and put plates on top of each other. Also, experts advise putting plates from carbs (potatoes and tomatoes) in the middle and protein (eggs) — on the edges.If you do this, the carb spots will be under the most powerful water streams. And the edges will soak for a longer time which is perfect for protein spots.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87124829.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 19. Chinese takeout containers can be unfolded into a plate.<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/17/023738/87125927/85959564.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
