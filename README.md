## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">20 Ground Rules for Boob-Watching from the Women Folk Themselves</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. If it’s a quick glance, it’s fine. That’s normal and feels mostly involuntary on behalf of the person looking. I notice but it doesn’t bother me. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121137/87169274/etiquette-02.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> If they stare at my boobs while other people are talking—or worse, while I’m talking—that makes me uncomfortable. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/011159/87169320/etiquette-06.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013504/87169372/etiquette-11.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> Fortunately, I’ve experienced glancing a lot more frequently than staring. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013434/87169369/etiquette-13.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/015156/87169383/etiquette-16.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013453/87169370/etiquette-14.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. When women wear graphic t shirts with writing on their chest I’m always hesitant to read it because I don’t want to look like a jackass. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013504/87169371/etiquette-12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013505/87169373/etiquette-15.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I can tell when someone is reading my shirt versus just staring at my boobs. I don’t mind people stopping and taking a good look at the text, I know it’s hard to read, I’ll even turn and fully face them so they can read it properly. I don’t mind this at all, if I’m going to slap a message on my tits I’m doing it cause I want people to read the message. No biggie! </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121114/87169272/etiquette-03.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> In fact asking a woman “what does your shirt say” is a really good way to break the ice. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/015227/87169386/etiquette-17.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> I’ve seen multiple people mention feeling uncomfortable reading name tags. It’s always okay to read name tags! They’re literally there to be read. I’ve seen some women put their name tags on their upper sleeve if they felt uncomfortable with drawing attention to their left tit so in that instance you’ll know a woman doesn’t want you staring at her chest. If you’re really uncomfortable with reading a name tag that’s okay, just introduce yourself and then ask their name. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121201/87169276/etiquette-05.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. You glance, dont stare, its like looking into the sun </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121126/87169273/etiquette-01.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Alright I am genuinely curious how many women do this? Is this a thing, changing mid-work day into a dress?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2605038/87169393.png" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">24 Pieces of Advice That Sound Crazy but Aren’t</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Do you understand, that if you try to endlessly stack bricks, no matter how perfect you do it, they will fall over? My boss told me this after I burned out. Just says that no matter how well you plan your work, too much is too much. -u/IsabellaCps</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168611.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Make them tell you no. Its great when youre not sure if you should apply for a job, go for a promotion or a raise, or do something youre afraid of. Dont be so worried about getting told no or failing, youll surprise yourself. -u/Marnett05</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168612.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “If you sit quietly while everyone else f*cks up, you’re going to win big!” -John Oliver. I’ve gotten multiple jobs and school opportunities by just doing my work and not being a loud moron. -u/Redqueenhypo</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168613.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. From my 7-year-old daughter…I still laugh about it today. If you’re ever in an awkward situation with someone or need to just go away, you could always pretend to choke on something. I don’t know where this came from but it’s funny AND it works. You just run away to get a glass of water. -u/Typical-me-</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168614.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If you need to remember something, write it 3x or say it out loud 3x. Always weird when you repeat something verbally 3x, especially names. -u/RainingRetro</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168615.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. If looking for something in a low light environment, try to use your peripheral vision. I read about it in an old WWII manual about aerial combat at night. It has something to do with how eyes work. It has helped me many times over the years. For finding stuff in a darkened room, or outside in a field at night, not aerial combat. -u/BMLortz</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168616.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. No one thinks about you as much as you do. Meaning we’re all worried about people thinking about the tiniest embarrassing things we do, when no one really cares. It gave me freedom to take on more challenges and not worry about failure. -u/derpitaway</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168629.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Dont give excuses unless they ask for it. I.E. if you are late for work, just say that you are late. Not why you are late. -u/Gurkeprinsen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168617.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Time will pass either way—if you want to work to get better at something, accomplish a long-term goal, or change careers or credentials, don’t look at the 2-5 years and think you’ll be too old. If you’re 24 and want to go to college, you’ll be 28 in four years with or without a degree regardless of what you do in that time. -u/Mild-Intrigue</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168618.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Anger and remorse are shadow companions, with remorse always a step behind. I took control over my temper issues by reminding myself of this one-liner. Hope this works for you, too! -u/Cogito747</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168619.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. It’s only embarrassing if you’re embarrassed. The older I get, the more I understand this one. -u/PB-JAM</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168620.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Fail quickly, as in: If your plan may not succeed, better to find out next week than next year. Helped me quit a suffocating job and dig into my own business 10/10. -u/NNakedLunchDate</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168621.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Primary Effect: the cold on your skin grabs your brains attention. You stop thinking about what was stressing you out and feel present in the moment. Secondary Effect: the cold cools your blood, which goes into your heart and slows down the beating.

As your heartbeat slows to maintain your body heat, your lungs breathe more slowly as well. It forces you to breathe, which calms you down.

Its meant to redirect negative self admonishment into a drive to grow and learn. And apparently, its sinking in because she will say something like Ugh, I cant make it up this hill! while were out bike riding and then catch me looking at her, give a big eye roll and go ...yet! in the exact tone you think a teenage girl would use. Then she ends up sometimes just rage-succeeding to prove the point, its great. Shes going to be at least 3 times better than me, low as that bar may be. -u/Zambeeni</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168634.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky11" id="linky10">23 Dirty Secrets Industries Are Hiding From The Public</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Midway games at carnivals or fairs purposely let people win early on in the day. This way people carry around the prizes and advertise them for the rest of the day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169111.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I was a deep sea diver for 10 years in the Gulf of Mexico. Huge oil spills happen and are covered up hundreds of times a year by every company. The entire industry is in on it. The bottom of the gulf is a disgusting garbage dump. Every boat dumps their trash into the gulf no one obeys the laws and the coast guard doesnt enforce s**t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169110.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I work in payroll. The number of payroll reports I see where people are conned out of their overtime is saddening.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169113.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Record labels and producers sometimes use ghost vocalists for pop stars who really cant sing. Ghost vocalists are like singing impressionists who come into the studio and re-sing the song in the style of the popstar, but better. Often the popstars in question dont even know that their vocals have been replaced.

Oh and, for the record (no pun), terrible singers cant be fixed with autotune, it is only used to polish slightly untidy vocals. This is why ghost vocalists are used.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169114.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Not sure if this is an industry practise, but a very popular online retail company in my country has no in-house web designers or any other IT staff beyond your generic networking techs. Any time their website or backend systems need work they simply advertise a permanent position and give the job of sorting out whatever they need done as a trial for the candidate. Once completed, they then inform them that the position is no longer available and send them on their way. Theyve been doing this for years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169116.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I work in a shipping company. Im a merchant marine engineer working on mega container ships. Lot of unethical shipping companies. They dump a lot of garbage, oily sludge, waste, contaminated water, and oil out when sailing in international waters far away from the shore because its cheaper to do that than land the waste to correct shore reception facilities. There are only a few handful of players (I can count them on my fingertips) today who are actually executing business trades, while still keeping the carbon footprint and environment as one of their core policies.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87169117.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. John Goodman His performance in 10 Cloverfield Lane was nothing short of perfection.

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Gene Wilder to me is special. He’s what my model of a complex sensitive man was growing up. Somehow not conventionally good-looking but sexy in that 70s way. Tender, sometimes furious, frantic, sophisticated, intelligent— and sings and dances. I loved him so much. And with Pryor, forget it. Even their mediocre films had such beautiful chemistry.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170242.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Jonah thought it was just a little unfair that a guy who looked like Channing could also be a natural comedic talent.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170264.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky18" id="linky17">20 Jobs That We Have Zero Respect For</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Scammers that scam old people via phone calls.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. MLM managers. Not the low level idiots that get suckered into it, they suck too for trying to bring new people into that sh*t-show, but the people who create them know exactly what they are doing.

<span style="font-size:4em">I know there are poachers that come from rural villages who are trying to just put food on the table, which have my sympathy. But poachers who come from money and hunt down animals minding their business in most shelters or restricted areas just to put a head on their wall as a trophy are absolutely heinous. -GetterdoneObiwan</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053933/87168605/scalping.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Jerry Lewis. He treated his family like shit, cut his kids out of his will and was a real pos on set. Watch some clips on youtube of him and his behaviour. Terrible. Most likely stemming from when he and Dean Martin split from being Martin & Lewis, everyone thought Dean would disappear and Jerry would go on to be a massive star. As it turned out, it was the complete reverse. He was a bitter, bitter person.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170033.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Frank Lloyd Wright. He is seen as a visionary in architecture but he was a horrible person IRL. Raging narcissist, abandoned his wife and kids to run off with the wife of one of his clients, nailed down his selected furniture in a clients home because he didnt like what the client wanted, etc.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170035.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. No one will say it because Americans have a hard time grappling with the military not being heroes, but Chris Kyle was a racist and a liar.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170031.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Jimmy Savile. Absolute monster. His celebrity as an English radio and tv personality gained him unrestricted access to hospitals with disabled children whom he abused.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Johnny Carson. He cheated on his wives and was an all around prick when he wasnt on camera. The most widely know example was him telling Joan Rivers that shed never become the star of The Tonight Show (she was the permanent guest host at the time), then refusing to ever speak to her again after she got a job elsewhere.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170043.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Picasso has been commonly characterized as a womanizer and a misogynist, being quoted as having said to one of his mistresses, Françoise Gilot, Women are machines for suffering. He later told her, For me there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats. In her memoir, Picasso, My Grandfather, Marina Picasso writes of his treatment of women, He submitted them to his animal sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them, and crushed them onto his canvas. After he had spent many nights extracting their essence, once they were bled dry, he would dispose of them.Of the several important women in his life, two, Marie-Thèrése Walter, a mistress, and Jacqueline Roque, his second wife, committed suicide. Others, notably his first wife Olga Khokhlova, and his mistress Dora Maar, succumbed to nervous breakdowns. His son, Paulo, developed a fatal alcoholism due to depression. His grandson, Pablito, also committed suicide when he was barred by Jacqueline Roque from attending the artists funeral. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170048.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Since no one mentioned them yet. Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. In her letters De Beauvoir mentions several romantic and sexual relationship with female students of hers, in one case she met a 17 year old student who she had a relationship, and later introduced her to Sartre who also began to have sex with her. There were a few others who basically made up Sartre’s personal harem, while de Beauvoir acted as the pimp; seducing teenage girls into threesomes with Sartre.Additionally both were signatories of a petition to remove the age of consent laws in France; the petition was written by a known pedo,Gabriel Matzneff, and signed by other French intellectuals including Foucault; who himself has been accused of sodomizing boys. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170050.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Lou Reed, I love the Velvet Underground but many of the band members were awful.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170051.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Frank Sinatra. My grandpas girlfriend and her husband used to work for him, and he was a right bastard. Didnt think that he had to pay people that worked for him, treated employees bad, all the usual human stuff. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170052.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I’ve worked for Prince and it’s a not so hidden secret he was absolutely awful to work with. There used to be a saying “you’re nobody in this industry until you’ve been fired by prince” He’s a legend for sure but was awful to those who put the show on, and his ego was out of control. And when it came down to it, he died from an OD, so for someone who was so quick to fire anyone over a simple mistake and he so critical of weakness, it turns out he had some hidden weaknesses of his own. Also, from all accounts Jim Morrison was an awful awful person.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170054.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
