## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">20 Jobs That We Have Zero Respect For</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Scammers that scam old people via phone calls. This isnt a job in the traditional sense but loads of call centers in India hire people to do this, you got to go through interviews and get paid a salary and commission. -Training_Exit_5849</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053823/87168589/callcenter.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Those journalists who write click-bait articles. The ones where you wade through page after page of deliberately prolonged text and ads to get to the bit you want to read. -Sloper59</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053827/87168590/clickbait.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Food bloggers who tell you the history of the world before giving you the recipe. -CCChic1</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053837/87168592/foodblog.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Health insurance company CEOs. -luhzon89</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053847/87168593/healthinsurance.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Higher level people in hospitals (admin, CEOs, etc.) Majorly detached from what’s actually going on in their facilities (or just don’t care) and implement policies that can legitimately be dangerous for patients so that they can get their bonus. -megs0114</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053850/87168594/hospital.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Dating experts. -Mean_Manufacturer_61</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053854/87168595/datingexpert.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. There are debt collectors who call relatives of the deceased to pay off their debts when they are not legally obligated to. -Top_Gun_2021</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053834/87168591/debt.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Life coach. -KidArcade</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053859/87168596/lifecoach.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Those people that work in the middle of the mall trying to sell you stuff. They just pray on older people and younger teens that dont know any better. -rosespetaling</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053903/87168597/mallkiosk.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Managers who have never worked the lower level positions. -JuniorMongoose9160</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053905/87168598/managers.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Psychic Mediums. Specifically those who prey on the grieving. -JamesDeadite</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053910/87168599/medium.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. MLM managers. Not the low level idiots that get suckered into it, they suck too for trying to bring new people into that sh*t-show, but the people who create them know exactly what they are doing. And they are pretty much the only ones who profit off of it. Should be illegal. Pyramid schemes are illegal. -Wereno</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053915/87168600/mlm.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Is being a Reddit mod a job? They probably think so. -NuclearWinterGames</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053918/87168601/mod.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Paparazzi. -VictorBlimpmuscle</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053922/87168602/paparazzi.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Poachers. Especially big game poachers who purposefully hunt nearly extinct animals from species they know are on the brink.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053927/87168603/poachers.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I know there are poachers that come from rural villages who are trying to just put food on the table, which have my sympathy. But poachers who come from money and hunt down animals minding their business in most shelters or restricted areas just to put a head on their wall as a trophy are absolutely heinous. -GetterdoneObiwan</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053933/87168605/scalping.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. TikTok Influencers. TikToks algorithm literally is not based on anything and people just go viral for the dumbest things, but when they are famous they act like they worked hard and are some kind of role model. -frankgumbomarchman</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053954/87168608/timeshare.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> If they stare at my boobs while other people are talking—or worse, while I’m talking—that makes me uncomfortable. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/011159/87169320/etiquette-06.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> Fortunately, I’ve experienced glancing a lot more frequently than staring. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013434/87169369/etiquette-13.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. When women wear graphic t shirts with writing on their chest I’m always hesitant to read it because I don’t want to look like a jackass. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013504/87169371/etiquette-12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I can tell when someone is reading my shirt versus just staring at my boobs. I don’t mind people stopping and taking a good look at the text, I know it’s hard to read, I’ll even turn and fully face them so they can read it properly. I don’t mind this at all, if I’m going to slap a message on my tits I’m doing it cause I want people to read the message. No biggie! </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121114/87169272/etiquette-03.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> In fact asking a woman “what does your shirt say” is a really good way to break the ice. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/015227/87169386/etiquette-17.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> I’ve seen multiple people mention feeling uncomfortable reading name tags. It’s always okay to read name tags! They’re literally there to be read. I’ve seen some women put their name tags on their upper sleeve if they felt uncomfortable with drawing attention to their left tit so in that instance you’ll know a woman doesn’t want you staring at her chest. If you’re really uncomfortable with reading a name tag that’s okay, just introduce yourself and then ask their name. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121201/87169276/etiquette-05.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky10" id="linky9">24 Pieces of Advice That Sound Crazy but Aren’t</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Do you understand, that if you try to endlessly stack bricks, no matter how perfect you do it, they will fall over? My boss told me this after I burned out. Just says that no matter how well you plan your work, too much is too much. -u/IsabellaCps</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168611.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Make them tell you no. Its great when youre not sure if you should apply for a job, go for a promotion or a raise, or do something youre afraid of. Dont be so worried about getting told no or failing, youll surprise yourself. -u/Marnett05</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168612.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “If you sit quietly while everyone else f*cks up, you’re going to win big!” -John Oliver. I’ve gotten multiple jobs and school opportunities by just doing my work and not being a loud moron. -u/Redqueenhypo</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168613.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. From my 7-year-old daughter…I still laugh about it today. If you’re ever in an awkward situation with someone or need to just go away, you could always pretend to choke on something. I don’t know where this came from but it’s funny AND it works. You just run away to get a glass of water. -u/Typical-me-</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168614.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If you need to remember something, write it 3x or say it out loud 3x. Always weird when you repeat something verbally 3x, especially names. -u/RainingRetro</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168615.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. If looking for something in a low light environment, try to use your peripheral vision. I read about it in an old WWII manual about aerial combat at night. It has something to do with how eyes work. It has helped me many times over the years. For finding stuff in a darkened room, or outside in a field at night, not aerial combat. -u/BMLortz</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168616.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. No one thinks about you as much as you do. Meaning we’re all worried about people thinking about the tiniest embarrassing things we do, when no one really cares. It gave me freedom to take on more challenges and not worry about failure. -u/derpitaway</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168629.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Dont give excuses unless they ask for it. I.E. if you are late for work, just say that you are late. Not why you are late. -u/Gurkeprinsen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168617.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Time will pass either way—if you want to work to get better at something, accomplish a long-term goal, or change careers or credentials, don’t look at the 2-5 years and think you’ll be too old. If you’re 24 and want to go to college, you’ll be 28 in four years with or without a degree regardless of what you do in that time. -u/Mild-Intrigue</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168618.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Anger and remorse are shadow companions, with remorse always a step behind. I took control over my temper issues by reminding myself of this one-liner. Hope this works for you, too! -u/Cogito747</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168619.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. It’s only embarrassing if you’re embarrassed. The older I get, the more I understand this one. -u/PB-JAM</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168620.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Fail quickly, as in: If your plan may not succeed, better to find out next week than next year. Helped me quit a suffocating job and dig into my own business 10/10. -u/NNakedLunchDate</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168621.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. If you cant fight the fear, do it scared. Got me through a lot of anxiety. -u/ChasingAlnilam</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168622.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. My mother always said Go back to basics whenever I was struggling mentally. I disregarded it for years but now I live by it.

## <a href="#linky14" id="linky13">24 Disturbing Facts That Ruined Our Day</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Flies dont have teeth. So, when they land on your sandwich and want to eat some, they barf up the contents of their stomach (often containing another animals shit) so the digestive enzymes can get on the food and then they eat. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167852.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. There are 32 missing nuclear weapons. And those are only the ones that we know of. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167853.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. There are guys with a fetish to cut off their penises. There’s even a subreddit dedicated to it. I found out about it a few months ago and it still haunts me. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167854.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. In my country some women rent babies to beg money with in the streets. They make them drink a pill that would make them sleep. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167855.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Anything can happen to anyone at any moment. I had my first seizure at 18. No family member has had epilepsy before. Never take anything for granted. It can all change in an instant.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167856.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Because of pregnant women, the average number of skeletons inside a human body is greater than one.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167857.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Often, burnt bodies are found in the same stance, known as the “Boxer Pose” due to muscles contracting from heat. It’s an incredibly disturbing looking thing, I first heard about it from my Grandfather that fought in Burma. During the war he was present at a Burmese funeral in which the cadaver was burnt on a pyre. Just as the flames began to singe the corpse, it sat up straight. The Burmese, of course, got a good laugh out of the British soldiers collectively shitting themselves, as contractions due to heat during cremation is apparently rather common. Doesn’t make it any less creepy. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167858.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. most modern knowledge on what happens when you go through hypothermia is almost entirely down the Nazi and Japanese human experiments.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167859.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Cyanide poisoning is an incredibly painful way to die. Cyanide was what Jonestown consumed for mass suicide. Parents were instructed to give it to their children and convinced the crying was just fear. Edit: For those asking about how cyanide works. If memory serves from when I first read this and listened to the audio recordings, it feels like a massive, massive heart attack. It may not have taken too much time, but any time greater than instantis too long to suffer before death. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167860.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. During World War 2, Japan bombed China with fleas infected with the bubonic plague. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167861.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. The horrendous practice of having a “dancing boy” AKA child sex slave in some regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. When families are poor they will sell their child to be a “dancing boy”. The children are frequently killed if they resist. It’s a rough watch but the documentary The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan covers this awful practice pretty well. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167862.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Pelicans are some of the most demonic birds in existence, if not some of the most demonic creatures. Pelicans will go into other birds nests, shove the parents out of the nest. They will then swallow babies whole, fly back to their own nests, and regurgitate the still half alive, partially digested babies, to their own babies for them to consume. Some pelicans are literally raised on the partially digested, living flesh of other baby birds. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167863.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. One of Mayhem’s band members committed suicide. When he was found by his bandmate, pictures were taken and it became the new album cover.

<span style="font-size:4em">16. That it takes three generations for you to be completely forgotten. Think about how you viewed your great grandparents. Sure you probably loved them but for most people their great grandparents die and are forgotten as you live your life. One day that will be all of us. Disappearing into the void, none to remember who we were, what our life was like or what we believed in. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167867.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. You can not prove that anyone else is real. The only thing you know for sure is you are conscious. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167868.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. I forget what its called but sometimes the artery that runs right next to your esophagus, over years of recurrent acid reflux can rupture. It fills your stomach with blood in seconds which causes you to vomit, which causes more damage. It fills you up with blood so fast that it eventually fills your lungs. This takes maybe a minute or two and is almost always fatal unless it happens to occur while youre in a hospitalYour last few minutes alive are spent vomiting pints of blood and then drowning in it. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167870.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Anesthesia awareness is a thing. Given the effects of anesthetics preventing the formation of new memories, its possible it always happens and we just dont remember it afterwards. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167871.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. By the time you show the symptoms of rabies, its already too late. (It can also be dormant for a year before you show those symptoms.) </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167872.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. The Nutty Putty Cave accident. Google for full disturbing details / a map of the cave, but basically a guy got stuck caving in a very narrow unmapped tunnel, UPSIDE-DOWN. They could not get him out, but almost did, one of the rescuers made eye contact with him apparently but then their pulley system broke and he fell further down. Unfortunately he ended up dying of cardiac arrest from being upside-down for so long and they couldn’t get him out / never retrieved the body because it was too dangerous for rescuers. Truly so disturbing, I’ve thought about it probably once a week since I found out about it a few months ago. Edit: even more disturbing now that someone gave this a wholesome award. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167873.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky19" id="linky18">25 Comedic Actors Who Became Fantastic Dramatic Actors</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. John Goodman His performance in 10 Cloverfield Lane was nothing short of perfection. The look of pure evil in his eyes when he killed that guy was horror at its finest.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170240.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Cranston did a spectacular job in Breaking Bad. I was never a big fan of Malcolm in the Middle (it was just ok), but going back through old Seinfelds on Netflix and Cranston as the dentist is hilarious.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170241.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Gene Wilder to me is special. He’s what my model of a complex sensitive man was growing up. Somehow not conventionally good-looking but sexy in that 70s way. Tender, sometimes furious, frantic, sophisticated, intelligent— and sings and dances. I loved him so much. And with Pryor, forget it. Even their mediocre films had such beautiful chemistry.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170242.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Bob OdenkirkHe seems kinda surprised about it, watching his interviews. But damn he does both well in the same role.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170243.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Kurt Russell was a Disney comedy actor for about 10 years until he did a TV movie about a mass shooter then hooked up with John Carpenter.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170244.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Olivia Coleman. Loved her in Hot Fuzz but was pleasantly surprised by her in the Favourite.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170245.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Hugh Laurie. Went from A bit of Fry and Laurie to Blackadder and then out of nowhere, House MD and then again with Night Manager.That man knows acting!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170246.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. John Lithgow. Seeing him in Dexter was a decent mindf*ck.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170247.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Bill Hader has been good in Barry.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170248.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Woody Harrelson. Great on Cheers and now has had several Oscar nominations.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170249.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Tom Hanks, if you remember him from his early career in the early 1980s, he was a talented comedy actor... but no way would I have imagined him doing dramas, let alone starring in them, let alone a string of hits.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170250.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Robin Williams. His performance in One Hour Photo is creepy as hell. The dude was absolutely a phenomenal actor no matter the genre. Insomnia has another great performance of his as well.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170251.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has come a long way from his “3rd Rock from the Sun” days.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170252.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Steve Carell. I loved him in Little Miss Sunshine!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170253.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Steve Buscemi. His performance in Boardwalk Empire was superb. Definitely disappoints me that he doesnt get more dramatic roles. Shook.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170254.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Jason Bateman. He has this way of making an insult sound like a compliment. F*cking gold.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170255.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Katey Sagal. From Peggy Bundy to Gemma Teller.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170256.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Jeff Daniels. Dumb & Dumber vs. The Newsroom.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170257.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Jim Carrey. I actually don’t like his comedy, but I love The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Truman Show.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170258.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Steve Martin transcends acting. He is a great comedian, comedy actor, and dramatic actor, yes. But, he’s also a great musician, artist, writer, and I assume some kind of scientist.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170259.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Jackie Gleason, from his own entertainment show, to the Honeymooners, to the Sherriff in Cannonball Express, has done some fantastic roles, Minnesota Fats, but one you might have seen is the 1986 film Nothing in Common with Tom Hanks.Gleason is so good, you can sense Hanks soaking up all the acting chops.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170260.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Donald Glover.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170261.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Sacha Baron CohenI wanted to see him as Freddie Mercury so bad.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170262.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Emma Stone. She went from Superbad and Zombieland to winning an Oscar for best actress.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170263.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Jonah Hill. So he and the director of 21 Jump Street basically had to bully Channing Tatum into reading for that movie, because Channing had never done a comedy before and didnt think he could pull it off. Turns out he was so funny that Jonah Hill was almost offended, because the short fat guy is supposed to be the funny one, not the big tall handsome guy. Jonah thought it was just a little unfair that a guy who looked like Channing could also be a natural comedic talent.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170264.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
