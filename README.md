<span style="font-size:4em">2. One weird car feature you may have seen is the small circular plastic button found on seatbelts.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The bumps we see on the bottoms of our favorite soda bottles are not solely made for marketing purposes.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. It is widely known that the hook at the end of a measuring tape is used to grab onto the edges of the object we’re trying to assess.
