<span style="font-size:4em">13. “I worked at a hospice and we had a wishing program. One of our patients, 24 year old with brain cancer, wanted to hold a sloth. Apparently, sloths are very nervous creatures, so its a little tricky to actually hold one. I found a local company that does visits to schools and whatnot who had a sloth. Sloths only poop about once a week and the sloth could only travel the day after he pooped (because they get nervous, any longer than that and the sloth has stress diarrhea). </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191596.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

So basically, we had to wait until the sloth pooped and then set up the visit for the next day. The sloth pooped on Thanksgiving, so we set up the visit for the next morning. The patient was able to hold and pet a very sweet sloth. The patient died about three weeks later, and I am very happy I was able to help give her some joy in her final weeks.” - ByteAboutTown</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191597.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

We closed the store early on a Sunday, then invited the kid and family in.

## <a href="#linky17" id="linky16">15 Trends People Will Regret in the Next Ten Years</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. “Posting way too much Information or pictures of your toddlers and children on social media. It will stay on the internet forever and some of the posts will be very embarrassing later on. It isnt like the kid really understands or consents to have their pics posted to social media.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/21/101608/87196451/trendsreplace.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “posting about almost every aspect of your life on social media. I posted some pretty cringe stuff as a kid that is still floating around somewhere, and that was before social media became big. I cant imagine what its going to be like now.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195051.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “Ape nfts.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195059.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “Ignoring criminal acts by politicians.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195058.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “I think people are just starting to regret naming their kids Danerys and Sansa.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195053.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “Facebook has explicitly encouraged its users to break down privacy barriers between different aspects of their life, e.g. work, school, and family. This is not a theoretical effect but an intentional one; Zuck has explicitly said that in his view, people who maintain boundaries between different parts of their life lack integrity and that its Facebooks goal to promote integrity in this specific sense. This is deeply dysfunctional.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195054.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “Quirky misspelling of names.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195055.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. “Too much plastic surgery, fillers and Botox on young people.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195056.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “Those eyebrows. Holy crap, there’s no way people wont regret those weird eyebrows.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195057.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “The destruction of public education (squeezing and outright sabotage of public schools, prohibitive costs for secondary education). The normalization of being undereducated, either through apathy or because of forces outside your control. The idea that opinion is equal to fact and that sticking to your original viewpoint is heroic. Yeah, your studies may say that, but this is how I FEEL about it and similar arguments. The reason we are no longer a minor species of omnivorous hunter-gatherers is our ability to pass along knowledge to others. Each generation building on the achievements of prior generations is the path to progress in health, quality of life, equality, production and so much more.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195060.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “Mommy bloggers who post constant pics and details of their children. Robbing children of privacy for likes and money is sickening. Don’t even get me started on ones with sick kids…”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195052.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “Some body modification trends. People in my age group are already regretting some of what they did to themselves in their early 20s. I cant imagine that this generation will fare any better.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195062.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “Letting companies freely track our online behaviors.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195063.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “Cruel pranks on strangers for views.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195064.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. “$1200 sneakers.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195065.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
