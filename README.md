<span style="font-size:4em">12. “People on the internet really seem to buy into the idea that elephants find humans cute. The source of this is a tumblr post that claims the same region of the brain thats active when humans see puppies is what lights up when elephants see us. But that requires MRI machines big enough to accommodate elephants, as well as keeping an animal that weighs like 5 tons still whilst its fully conscious. It also means assuming that the brain structures do the same job across species.

<span style="font-size:4em">
If anything, the harsh reality is that wild elephants probably see humans as threats, given that as a species were actively doing our best to kill them. Elephants who live in zoos or sanctuaries may be endeared to their keepers and thus humans in general, however. The good news is that this can probably change if poaching is ever stopped. Elephants whod been raised in the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, for example, have led sick or injured herd-mates back to the sanctuary for treatment.” -ButterflyOfDeath</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174571.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “That humans will eventually evolve to lose the little toe as we dont use it. No, thats not how evolution works. Unless at some point in the future not having one increases our chances of reproducing, the little toe is not going anywhere. Also regarding evolution, we didnt exactly evolve from monkeys, its more like monkeys and us share a common ancestor, but then we split into different evolution branches.” -Dr_Chemiramen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174573.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Last week: 3 women admiring my fiancé’s new engagement ring (which is a bit flashy)My fiancé tells them it’s lab-made, which is what she wantedOne of them responded with “Oh, that doesn’t count then”-u/VertibirdGoBoom</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176097.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Ive started reading a lot of forums of expecting mothers and mothers, and is terrifying to see how much pressure there is regarding birthing and motherhood: youll never be a proper mother if you have a c-section; you will never bond properly/be a good mother if you dont breastfeed; if you dont do X or Y or Z your child will be unhappy/unloved/will die and it will be your fault.And measuring a womans worth over the power of their vaginas: shame on you for doing IVF, there must be something wrong if you had only miscarriages, adopting is fine, but is the acceptance of failure, bio moms are best moms.-u/Kaliforniah</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176100.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Makeup and fashion fans bullying you for how you show your femininity and performing it not being your priority. If your makeup is not flawless and in trend, not okay. If you dont wear feminine, flattering clothes, not okay.-u/throwaway_thursday32</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176101.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. If you gave birth through c-section, youre not a real mom.What. The. F*ck? Suddenly 9 months of pregnancy, a terrifying procedure and caring for a newborn doesnt count because MacDuff from his mothers womb was untimely ripped? Whose baby is this then, since apparently, no mothers are present?-u/CaptValentine</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176102.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Shaming other girls/women for not doing/liking the same things you do and implying that their preferences make them not real women or similar. Basically saying that your way to be a woman is the only valid way.-u/rinky79</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176103.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Queen bee bullying at the workplace. Basically, letting high school never end. About 60% of women experience it.Men bully as well, but women bullying women isnt even acknowledged as a problem most of the time.-u/raxeira-etterath</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176104.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Whatever is happening in Facebook birthing/mom groups. Some women are so out of touch with reality and high on toxic femininity that they think their uteruses are better than any doctor and that their feminine intuition supersedes any medical testing or intervention available today. Women are being brainwashed into skipping fetal testing and to avoid medical intervention even in life or death situations. It is literally killing mothers and babies and injuring a lot more.-u/no_ovaries_</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176105.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I see a lot of body-positive women that sh*t on my girlfriend for working out and keeping her body hairless. They always say she should be more loving of her body and embrace her body hair.It’s annoying. She does it cause SHE likes it. She goes to the gym and does deadlifts cause it empowers her and makes her feel AMAZING. Like, we all have different ideals and visions for our life. And after moisturizing herself and shaving she likes to rub her legs together like a cricket, and nobody should be taking that little slice of heaven from her.-u/Euowol</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176107.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Being unable to critize another woman for sh*t she did since women support each other.

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Is it just me or is the term “Happy wife, happy life!” a little messed up? I’ve mostly been told this from women but idk it sounds purely a way to be controlling of your partner-u/Public-Juggernaut-56</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176111.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Believing that its a mans job to impress her when shes dating. F*ck that, if you like someone ACT AS THOUGH YOU LIKE THEM. Dating is an equal exchange of time and emotional labor, if she feels like she needs further financial compensation beyond that (paying for the food/show/whatever it is) then maybe she doesn’t like him enough.-u/BrainHurtingJuice129</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176112.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Abusive or possessive behavior, not only towards their husband/wife, but also towards friends and family.The classic “if you scream at me, I’ll call the police and tell them you hit me even though I’m the wrong here”-u/Strong_Month_3534</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176113.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Testing. This applies to testing their romantic partners just as much as their friends/family. Where they intentionally put someone in a situation that is rigged against them in order to judge them in some fashion based on their reaction.Im not claiming this is a feminine-only trait, but in my personal experience Ive seen it come from women much more than men.My sisters friend recently gave her permission to pursue a guy they were mutually attracted to. My sister did, and it turned out that the friend was only testing to see if my sister was a real friend or not.

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Expecting all the affection and love in the world from their boyfriends and never showing a glimpse of it towards them.

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Sh*tting on stay at home moms or Sex Workers because you dont understand their choices. Feminism means we all get to choose our own path.

## <a href="#linky13" id="linky12">25 Most Absurd Confessions from Strangers</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Moved to a neighborhood not to long ago, and the first person I meet was an older woman in her 50s. She told me all about her drug use and how sometimes she ends up outside naked and asked if I would help her back inside and put clothes on her. This was all in 5 minutes of saying hello. -Horribleheadaches</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167809.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Visited a coffee shop for the first time on holiday. Barista commented on my tattoos. I said thank you. She told me shes not allowed to get tattoos but she cuts herself to enjoy the pain and thats nearly the same thing. I found a different coffee shop for the rest of the holiday. -kyridwen

</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167800.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Chatted with a huge middle-aged dude in a bar once who after about 2 minutes, told me that he had been in prison for bashing his dads head in with a hammer. His dad used to beat his mom and one day hed had enough of it. -RVT223</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167801.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Temporary coworker tells me she was kidnapped, raped and beaten by her ex husband. Burned with cigarettes, hands shoved in the garbage disposal, head beaten with a hammer. The incident resulted in a baby she somehow still has. And they’re not even divorced because he won’t sign the divorce papers. I work in a small town gas station, I’m trying to check out customers and she’s reciting a true crime episode to me. The conversation started with mascara recommendations. It was the craziest thing I’ve ever heard -whydidithavetobeme-</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167802.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Stuck driving a coworker out to a remote gas plant to do a system install. He was kinda f**ked up but assumed it was just socially awkward IT way. Nope. He starts telling me about him and his dad collecting nazi memorabilia and how proud he was of his German grandparents. Trying to make other small talk and he would just trail off answering questions and start singing to himself. Thought for sure I’d end up on the news and a manhunt would be conducted. -Dice_to_see_you</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167803.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Second best story - met the neighbour right after we moved in and she started telling me about them wanting another kid but doing the deed was hard because she was overweight, and had bad knees and it just made it difficult. I’m a guy who never met her and have my kids playing mere feet away so I can’t call her batshit crazy. -Dice_to_see_you</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167804.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Oh, I have another one. Girl I worked with but didnt really know beyond her name. Told me she liked to hold her boyfriends penis and do the aiming for him when he took a piss. -kyridwen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167822.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. A customer explained to me the benefits of a coffee enema to heal everything from my acne to preventing cancer. I couldnt get her to leave me alone for an hour because it was dead and no one was there to help. I worked for a skincare counter in a department store.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Like if you dont need my products because cleaning your a** with coffee fixes it, why are you here? But she went on about how she started her kids on these and did their enemas until they could do theirs on their own. What. Then she also grabbed my hands and kept saying promise me youll try it. Promise me. She left after I promised. No, I didnt try it. -TenaciousToffee</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167807.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. A guy told me during our first shift that his youngest daughter was suicidal, his eldest daughters boyfriend was terribly abusive, and his wife was sleeping with someone at her work. Apparently he’d just gotten out of jail after flying home from out of state, beating the sh*t out of his daughters boyfriend, his brothers, and his dad, driving to his wife’s work and beating the sh*t out of her boyfriend.

Then driving to the hospital to hold his daughters hand after she had attempted suicide until the cops arrived to arrest him for aggravated assault. -mitch1832</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167811.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Had to get my picture taken for a visa so went to a local photography shop that took the pictures and printed them out for you right there. I had been talking to the guy as he worked on other peoples photos and when I finally got my picture taken he started opening up about his family.
Apparently his son was killed 3 years ago in a car accident and he was telling me how much I reminded him of his son (going to school for engineering, 1st generation college student etc.) The son was killed in his senior year so didnt even get to graduate, he even showed me pictures it was heartbreaking.

<span style="font-size:4em">
To make things worse he said he had a degenerative muscular disease and doctors had given him about 2-3 years before hed be bed ridden. He then went on to say his daughter was taking care of him and how she isnt married yet and deserves to live a young persons life and man, it really put into perspective how bad some people have it. I still think about that guy to this day and hope hes doing well. -EA721</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167814.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I made the unfortunate mistake of inviting my old neighbour over when we were having a party. He had like five gins in my kitchen and confessed to an unsolved murder in Nunavut, Canada. Hes in jail. -_HossBonaventureCEO_</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167815.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Sat on an Amtrak across from a very sweet older man, who within twenty minutes was telling me about the purpose of his trip to Maryland: to meet his biological father, who he had discovered via 23andMe, to discuss changing his last name, which was the condition of becoming being the sole inheritor of his father’s estate. And that he was feeling a little guilty about that because his three half sisters would be excluded from their father’s will because he “finally had a legacy.” Woof. He disembarked twenty minutes later, and I have thought about it constantly for the following four years. -mom_jean</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167816.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Hitchhiking through New Zealand, I got picked up by a semi driver. Awesome guy, but an hour into the drive started unloading every bit of personal information he could. How he’s cheated on his wife, screwed the company out of money, stolen items… It was like I was a priest in a confession booth. When I asked him why he told me all of that, he said it’s been eating him up inside for years and telling me helped get it off of his chest. He said I had no idea who he or anyone he knew was, so it felt like I was the perfect person to unload on. -birdizthawerd</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167819.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. A girl I was dating mentioned that her dad was sleeping with her older sister, and that she would soon be next.

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Used to work at a ski resort and was working in a different area than I normally work. Well this lady who I was working with found out I was slightly acquainted with her fiance and proceeded to tell me all about how his family hates her and is mean to her and all about his substance abuse issues. I dont remember all the details because it was a few years ago but she unloaded on me with every issue of her relationship and Im like Im just here to work. I didnt really even know her fiance. I avoided that lady after that. -beau8888</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167821.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. My favorite ever was some stranger outside a bar. Seemed normal enough until she said My husband and I used to do meth, but we dont anymore. I applauded her on this and then she followed up with Yeah, now we only have meth weekends. -FaintCommand</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167823.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. New roommate told me her current boyfriend got kicked out of college for sexual assault and was under investigation for another case of sexual assault. Wanted my opinion about it within like two hours or meeting. Completely disregarded that my opinion was “run”. -Ohnoimgonnarunoutofc</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167824.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
