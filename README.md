<span style="font-size:4em">8. I was on a little league baseball team with these two brothers named Doer and Achiever.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. So my Wife was giving birth to our first Son and the midwife asked if we’d chosen a name yet. We said yes and told her ‘Seth’. She replied “Oh thank goodness, a normal name! The last woman in here named her child Precious Bunny!”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177390.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I used to write on cakes, the worst name I ever saw was Tuba Poo. I asked if it was a nickname, it was not. Its been like 6 years and it still haunts me. Her mothers name was Natalie, why Natalie? Why?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177391.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. The overly matchy names to the point of ridiculousness. My top example is a set of brothers named Romance, Romantic, and Romeo.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177393.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Back when I worked with children, I met a young lass named Younique. I felt sorry for her. She was only 4-5 at the time, and the moment she entered school, she began to hate it because the other children thought that it was silly and wouldn’t play with her. Eventually, the dad of another child said that it was a bad name *to her face.* Seriously. Don’t do things like this to your children. They aren’t pets. They’ll have to deal with the repercussions of your bad naming choices.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177381.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Someone I know is a nurse in the ER so theyve delivered quite a few babies. But one day they said that one set of parents decided to name their kid Ssss. You pronounce Ssss, Forest.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177394.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Baby. As in the Dirty Dancing lead female. Because nobody in the professional world is going to want their name to be Baby.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177395.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Kash. It isnt the worst name in the world but the fact his second name was Ransom, made it a whole lot worse.

<span style="font-size:4em">18. MyLuv (yes, I have met a kid named this). That poor kid is probably not going to be successful, unless they change their name later on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177398.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I went to high school with a one Crystal Shanda Lear.

This was back before dumb names were the rage. She would have been named that in, say, 81-82. Poor girl. I dont know that I lost respect for the parents so much as felt bad for her to be saddled with that s**t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177399.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. I lose respect for parents who give their kids first names that when added to their given last names become horrible. The parents dont even care that their kid has to live with it. Two real examples Ive come across are Richard Sieman (The guys name is D**k Semen, for f***s sake.) And even worse, Desire Cox.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177400.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Anaesthasia. No s**t. Her name on her school documents was Anaesthasia.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177401.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. One of my former employees had the first name “Baby Destiny.” Yes. Really.

Worse still, HR just put “Baby” on her name badge. For every time I had to catch myself and say the full name so I didn’t sound like a creep, I can only imagine how many other people didn’t realize there were two words in her name and had to refer to her as just Baby. Or how she must have felt to have EVERYONE calling her Baby.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177402.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. You know the Duggar family (19 Kids and Counting)? One of their daughters named their son Spurgeon. SPURGEON.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177404.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. I knew three sisters names -Autumn-Breeze, Summer-Skye and April-Rain.

Bonus addition one of them had a kid and named it Gidget.

Woman: Her name is Sri Lanka, S R I space L A N K A...

Me: Oh, you mean like the country!

My mom is a midwife and one day she came home with what she thought was the epitome of dumb names.

These parents had just gotten back from a trip to the states, where they had visited a dock to look at boats, and one of those beautiful boats had an even more beautiful and exotic name, they wanted to name their baby daughter after this boat.
