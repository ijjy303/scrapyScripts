<span style="font-size:4em">10. PT BARNUM.

Most people know but due to the romanticization of The Greatest Showman, people should know that he was a maniac that did an ungodly experiments on living beings, locked people in cages, abused them, and mocked them. All whilst earning pocket from them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155850.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Einstein wasn’t a great guy. Brilliant, sure, but kinda douchy in his personal life.

He refused to marry his long time lover for years, even after she got pregnant. The child was assumed to be given up for adoption, but no record has ever been found.

He and his wife, Mileva Marić, worked together on their research. People saw them do it. They made jokes about it at parties. He proudly told people that she did all his calculations. They only put his name on their work and he went on to claim all the credit - ignoring any work she had done. Part of their agreement was that she would get the Nobel prize money but he tried to prevent that.

She raised two children - one schizophrenic - took care of the house and tutored to bring in extra money because he couldn’t get a job for a long time. He started getting more notoriety and then began an affair with his first cousin.

He moved to a different country to be with his new hillbilly mistress. He divorced his wife and quickly married the new, younger model. He had rules she had to abide by, such as leaving the room immediately when told and not expecting or asking for any sort of affection except when necessary for appearances sake.

Elsa, his second wife, was dying and he worked nonstop because he didn’t know what to do (I guess). She was basically abandoned her last few months.

He cheated on both his wives, numerous times. Ignored his children. Oh - and he was pretty into his second wife’s daughter and thought about marrying her instead.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155851.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. King Edward the VIII was a nazi sympathizer who possibly colluded with the Germans to retake the throne in the event of an invasion and conquest of Britain.

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Oliver Cromwell

Tried to make England a republic, ended up being a king in all but name. Butchered the Irish, banned Christmas and is partially responsible for the puritans (who fled to America after the monarchy was restarted)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155854.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Steve Jobs. The way he treated his family is horrible.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155855.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Coco Chanel was a goddamn Nazi spy. Yes, she was an incredible designer, and shes probably one of the most influential humans of the 20th century, based on the number of people who have worn clothing directly inspired by her over the past 100 years. She really did change the way women dress in a truly radical way, and I respect that - knitwear, feminized menswear, ditching the corset, transforming black into an everyday color, the essential skirt suit, costume jewelry, synthetic fragrances in perfume, the list goes on.

But she was a goddamn Nazi spy. Coco was a wretched anti-Semite, like so many other members of the European elite during the 30s. She dated a number of staggeringly wealthy British aristocrats and theyd all sit around talking about the Protocols of Zion and s**t, trying to figure out whether any members of the royal family were secretly Jews, etc. When war broke out, the two Jewish brothers who ran her perfume empire (aka Chanel No 5, the best selling perfume in the world then and now) had to flee to the US for safety. How did Coco respond? By writing to the Nazis to ask them to transfer ownership over to her, a good Aryan, so she could make more money. But thats not the half of it.

She fell in love with a dashing German spy named Spitz whod been seducing bluebloods all over France and England for years leading up the war. Coco was a useful woman - she was simply one of the richest women in the world, and she knew everyone in the British aristocracy, including her old hunting buddy and dear friend, Winston Churchill himself. She and Spitz socialized with all the biggest Nazi names in town, especially Otto Abetz, the Nazi ambassador to France, who invited them to every party in town. Spitz convinced her to join the Abwehr (aka the German secret service) and make trips to Spain. Operating under the code name Westminster, she attempted to broker a separate peace between Germany and England. (In the meantime, she may or may not have reported at least one woman at the Hotel Ritz whom she suspected of being Jewish to the SS.) She had a grand old time going on her adventures, and wrote about the excitement of working for the Abwehr in her private notes.

Chanel was arrested only a few days after the liberation of Paris - absolutely everyone in town knew what shed been doing and who shed been doing it with - but for rEaSoNs UnKnOwN she was released without charges. Its widely believed that Winston Churchill personally intervened. It might be because the two of them had been close friends for decades. It might be because she was going to embarrass the s**t out of Britain by outing all the anti-Semites and pro-Nazis in the British aristocracy - including the recently abdicated Edward VIII who used his f***ng honeymoon as an excuse to tour Nazi Germany and shake Hitlers hand. She spent the rest of her life being a nasty, bitter morphine addict living in the Hotel Ritz. The House of Chanel has very, very little to say about the matter, and every few years a few more bits of damning evidence are declassified from the vaults.

If you want to learn more, I did a whole episode about her Nazi days in my French history podcast: The Collaborator</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155844.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Kinda coming much more into light now but The Founding Fathers, all of them owned slaves and by modern day standards they would be horrible people. But something I think lots of people don’t remember is even if these things are utterly reprehensible, everyone was doing it and they were all children of their time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155857.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Benito Juárez

He was the type of president who kills his opposition instead of negotiating. He did a lot of illegal executions.

He was going to be executed in Guadalajara, however one of his ministers convinced the soldiers not to kill him with a famous phrase alto, los valientes no asesinan, the soldiers forgave his life and risked theirs as the disobey an order. Well, as soon as Juarez returned to Mexico city, he immediately ordered to kill all of those soldiers with no mercy (source: my sister worked with the Sargents descendant)

After Juárezs government, theres a period Known as the porfiriato, where Porfirio Díaz was Mexicos president for 30 years. It was possible just because there was no opposition alive

Juarez suddenly died in 1872 from a heart attack. Its believed that a woman, to avenge his husband, worked on his home as a maid, and when she had the opportunity, she put an infusion of veintiunilla a herb known by the natives for being poisonous and cause a heart attack 21 days (veintiún dias) after it was drank</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155858.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Not quite beloved, but Joseph P. Kennedy Sr..

He decided that Rosemary (his daughter) who was 23 at the time should have a lobotomy; he did not inform his wife of this decision until after the procedure was completed. And then they sent her away to an institute.

In her early young adult years, Rosemary Kennedy experienced seizures and violent mood swings. In response to these issues, her father arranged a prefrontal lobotomy for her in 1941 when she was 23 years of age; the procedure left her permanently incapacitated and rendered her unable to speak intelligibly.

<span style="font-size:4em">22. William Hurt. I remember seeing tons of praise for him when he passed recently.

Thing is, he beat and raped Marlee Matlin back in the 80s. She discussed it in her memoir. When he was approached about it, his response wasnt to deny it, but to apologize for any pain he may have caused to her.

If you want to praise his acting, fine. But remember what sort of person he was behind the characters you loved on film.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155861.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Margaret Sanger was pro-eugenics and a racist.

In promoting birth control, she advanced a controversial Negro Project, wrote in her autobiography about speaking to a Ku Klux Klan group and advocated for a eugenics approach to breeding for “the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extinction, of defective stocks — those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.”

## <a href="#linky12" id="linky11">The 25 Scariest Things People Saw in Prison</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. 1. “My cell mate was truly crazy and was tortured by hallucinations.One day he managed to gouge one of his eyes out with a fork at lunch in front of everyone, then puncture the other eye with something before the screws could get to him.He was screaming like a banshee when he ripped the first one out and threw it on the floor, and everyone just stared in shock, including the screws, at first it looked like a skit or something. After the one was out he went really quiet and pulled something from his waist and started rapidly stabbing the other eye with it. I heard it pop.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158803.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. 2. “When I was 20 years old I thought I wanted to be a correctional officer. One night I was sent to work at the medical ward where each inmate had their own isolated cell where they were let out twice a day. That night I was going around with the nurse giving the inmates their medicine and we came to one inmates cell and as soon as we opened the door I was knocked backed by the most putrid smell I have ever smelled in my life. Ive been to the dump plenty of times in my life and it was nothing in comparison to the smell this inmate had going on. Once we were done giving out the medicine, I went up to the officer training me and asked him what was going on with that inmate and why he smelled so God awful. He said Oh, you met Grady? He sh**s and pisses himself on purpose. He never changes or showers so he constantly lives in his own filth. I found out that he was r*ped once in prison. So he started sh**ting and pissing himself so he wouldnt be r*ped anymore.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158804.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. 3. “I was in Lawrenceville Penitentiary in VA, from 2011-2014. From a penitentiary standpoint it was quite accommodating! They had all the drugs, alcohol, cigs and cell phones you could ever dream of. I was working in the kitchen towards the middle of my bit, making myself an egg sandwich one morning. This young dude got into a dispute with a dude everybody knew as Unk, who by the way was a super quiet guy who didn’t mess with anyone. They were apparently arguing over a cigarette, when the young buck called Unk a “Bitch”. Unk grabbed an institutional can of green beans, baseball pitched it across the kitchen and nailed young buck in the face. Unk ran over to young buck, picked the can back up and beat him across the face with it! When he was done ripping young bucks face off with that can, he spit on him and said ”that’s what happens when you call a real man a bitch!” That was the last time I ever called any man a bitch!”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158805.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. 4. “Not me, but- I spoke to a former inmate after his release who had developed severe ptsd from some of the things he witnessed while incarcerated. One of the stories was that he was playing cards with some guys and one of them was smoking a cigarette. Another inmate who was not playing with them approached the table and asked the guy smoking if he could get “shorts” on the cigarette ( shorts means, before you finished smoking, you gave the cigarette to someone else so they got the last few puffs of the cigarette before putting it out) the smoker agreed, the inmate wandered off and they went back to playing cards. Well the guy playing cards must have forgot and finished the cigarette. A little while later the other inmate came back to the table asking for the short, and the guy at the table told him that he had forgotten about it and finished the cigarette. Guy wanders off again and they go back to playing cards. Shortly afterwards, the inmate who wanted shorts comes back to the table, comes up behind the player, pulls his head back and started shanking him in the eye and throat with a pen/pencil. Dude died over forgetting to give someone a damn cigarette butt.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158806.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. 5. “My criminal justice professor always used to tell us about the million dollar man in his prison he used to work at. The prison was an old school style with multiple floors and the open part of the middle like you see in the movies. To avoid jumpers they put chainlink fencing along the walkways. One day this guy managed to squeeze through the fencing on the third floor and swan dive face first to the concrete floor below. When they came in they all thought he was dead until he began making noises. The prisoner was then transfered to a hospital for a year and a half getting around 12 different surgeries. Eventually he was released back to the prison and on his second month back he did it again but didnt survive this time. The running joke was that he was named the million dollar man because he had cost taxpayers millions from all his surgeries and time in the hospital. Our teacher also liked to add in every time he told the story that some how his glasses survived both falls completely fine.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158807.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. 6. “A dude got two full kettles of boiling water poured on his head. And a convicted murderer explaining how he killed, dismembered with an angle grinder then disposed of the body.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158808.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. 7. “My brother said a guy across from him had a new cellmate who had gastrointestinal problems and wouldnt stop farting these rancid horrible farts after the guy told him repeatedly to stop (not like he could help it,) so the guy beat the farter to death in their cell with his bare hands. My brother said he had never seen so much blood from one person before.” </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158809.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. 8. “I did a 4 month stint in Kajang (Malaysia). This Nigerian dude used to pilfer from other cells. This Malay gang found him and dipped his hand in boiling oil (basically deep fried it while it was still attached to him). That scream, it still curdles my blood. Poor guy was reduced to an unconsious pool of blood, sweat, tears, vomit, shit and piss. He lost more than his hand on that day.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158810.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. 9. “In another unit in the same month a guard suplexed a dude who had to weigh 110lbs wet for talking back to him. The guy broke his neck and died. You can find the story of this online by searching WCDC bodyslam death. The guard was charged w manslaughter, not sure if he was convicted.” </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158811.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. 10. “I was in a South American prison, there was a lot of drug addicts, they usually sold their food in order to buy more drugs so they were always hungry. One day I was eating my lunch: rice, a leg of chicken and some beans. When I finished my meal there were some chicken bones left in my plate, and a drug addict approached to me to ask if I could gift him the chicken bones. So I lend him my bones and he started eating them. It was heartbreaking”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158812.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. 11. “A guy got stomped to death my first day in. The 2 guys fighting were rival gang members. The guards didnt do anything until the guy getting stomped stopped breathing. Then they came in and took them both away. One in a bag and one in cuffs.” </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158813.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. 12. “Dude in the cell next to mine tried to kill himself with a sharpened pencil. He just kept stabbing himself in the chest but couldn’t get deep enough. He was hauled off by COs kicking and screaming, begging for death. He was going to be deported.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158814.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. 13. “Brixton, A Wing. Coming back from canteen this scary looking wild eyed dude steps across and tells me to hand over my burn/tobacco. I laugh and say no and walk by, waiting for him to do something. Nothing happened. Few minutes later, same guy opened some poor lads stomach with one slash and he was lying there trying to hold his intestines in, I saw the fear and panic on his face. The scary guy just casually walked away. No idea what happened to either of them. Alarms went off. Everyone back to their cells and locked up again.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158815.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. 14. “Boiling hot peanut butter dumped on a sleeping child molesters face …. The screaming and thrashing was pretty intense…. The idea is that you can’t wipe it off or something to mitigate the damage caused, it’s going to burn deeply. And in my opinion, that was worse than watching a guy on the bench press take a 35k plate smash to the scull repeatedly…. He was dead pretty quickly… the peanut butter burn is a permanent disfigurement that will have months of pain and suffering.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158816.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. 15. “I don’t know if this counts but, my dad was in prison with Richard Speck, who is, if you don’t know, an American mass murderer who brutally murdered and raped 8 nurses. My dad told me during his time in prison, Speck bragged about what he did all the time, and said prison was a wonderful vacation for him and he would do it all again if he had the chance. He would even go as far as saying how much he loved to kill those women. So sickening. Speck also made porn in prison, which I’m sure is on the internet somewhere.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158817.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. 16. “I was never in prison, but in jail a bit for drug charges. I was in my 30s, but my bunky was a really nice 19 yo kid in there for selling drugs. He seemed a bit over his head, but introduced me to the jits (I didn’t know anyone) and we’d play cards and shit. He had a real high bond, and one day they said to get his shit he got bail. He didn’t know who, but I was so happy for him. The next morning the co told me he was shot and killed that night (Being very respectful, everyone liked the guy). It was confirmed on the evening news. Really fucked me up, and I can guess who got him bailed.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158818.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. 17. “I saw someone take a hotpot fill it up with baby oil add a pound of sugar, add some magic shave, bring it to a boil then splash it in a persons face...... It literally melted the guys face off. This happened around 1999 and I still have the occasional nightmare about it” </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158819.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. 18. “Just the way that some people talk about murder. Some of the people in there would be telling a story, casually drop the fact that they killed someone, then keep going on with the story like nothing happened.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158820.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. 19. “I was sitting in TV room in the Feds. The inmate phones in this particular institution are situated in little phone booths. No idea why, but on the move, a guy ran up in the housing unit and stabbed the guy 15 or so times in the booth. 3 in the face. Dude couldn’t go anywhere. Slumped immediately. Second, two guys in the kitchen made a bet that one of them wouldn’t go through the commercial dishwasher. Guy took the bet and went through…. Came out the other side as one human sized blister, 100% of his skin was blistered full of juice. He was airlifted out in a bubble wrapped suit to hospital. I was fresh in at the time and working in the kitchen when this happened. But I wasn’t in the dish room. The blood curdling screaming as the dishwasher cycled on still gives me goosebumps 10 years later. And I can’t un-see what a human covered in blisters looks like. I don’t know if he survived as they don’t give updates to inmates. I do know the guy who bet him was charged with fresh street charges.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158821.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. 20. “Not a crazy story but was in for a few days and didnt realize they put you in cells based on the color of your skin. Im a white dude with a Hispanic last name and they put me in a cell with a straight nazi who told me if I went to actual prison ( I was only in for a weekend) that I would be a misfit because I wasnt one thing or the other. He openly called the black dudes next to our cell horrible things.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158822.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. 21. “I’m not a con but my dad told me when he was up stream, guards informed them that they had a high case child rapist coming in. When the guy got there he ended up being this old white man walking with a cane. He didn’t last very long on the court yard. (They killed him on the prison yard)”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158823.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. 22. “Massive open wound flesh gashes down to the bone made by herself on her forearms and top of the legs that she used to “hide” things in, like paint brushes, coffee rations, pens etc. I could literally see her bones.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158824.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. 23. “Relayed by a friend but he said the craziest thing about prison is how you inevitably meet someone who is more psychotic / sociopathic than the next guy. You think you’ve seen it met some bad dudes on the streets but there’s always a bigger fish.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158825.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. 24. “Some forensic photos the guy in the cell next to me showed me of his victims (corpses, he killed them after he tortured them), in gang related abductions. He removed a tattoo with an electric sander, and knives in both eye sockets, still in. (They were part of his trial evidence.)” </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158826.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. 25. “Ok so unfortunately, my bunk was close to the corner where everybody came to fight or whatever. So this one guy claimed that he was a gang member but it was discovered that he was a false-flagger. So, the gang members put him in the corner and took turns beating and raping him. He was in the infirmary for bout a week. When he came back, the gang got him all over again. He was transferred after that. I promise there arent many things more terrifying than hearing a grown man scream while hes being raped.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158827.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky13" id="linky12">25 Seemingly Innocent Songs That Are Really about Sex</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. The Foo Fighters All My Life is about going down on a girl. It never occurred to me at all until I read that Dave Grohl said in an interview, That song is a little dirty. Im very fond of giving oral sex to women.

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I grew up listening to Meat Loaf a lot because my dad played it on every car ride. One of my favorite songs was Paradise by the Dashboard Lights. My oh-so-innocent child mind didn’t pick up on the meaning of the lyrics until I rediscovered the song about a month ago. I guess this one isn’t so innocent. The song is blatantly about having sex in a car and I just never realized it when I was a kid. - breakthefifthwall</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158896.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Cell 39 was on the upper landing, and hard to see from outside. They were screaming at me to go up there and help. I said just wait, I need my other officer. They kept screaming there was no time. I had to go. It didnt feel right. I held my ground and as soon as my male officer opened the door they all disappeared. They just wanted to rape and probably kill me.

Whenever I stopped in at a major Canadian airport I would grab a mess of Air Canada luggage tags.

Alot of my American contemporaries would ask for them when flying commercial to put on their luggage, especially when flying through the Middle East and Africa.

The American luggage was targeted for abuser, theft, etc

They never touched Canadian bags.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157185.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If you bring a box of chocolates for the flight crew, you will get all the free snacks (and sometimes beers) they can throw at you.

My old coworker had been a flight attendant for like 20 years and knew all the secrets. This was his best recommendation for a good flight.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157186.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I worked for the ground crew at a private airport. Flights from other countries have to throw away all uneaten food right off the plane, as it is International Waste, and needs to be incinerated.

Additionally, if flights for private planes are delayed, their food that was standing by has to go somewhere... So they gave it to us. So tasty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157187.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Used to work for a UK airline (non crew).

It was normal for passengers that died onboard to be kept in their seats until landing. They would be wrapped in blankets and propped up to look like they were sleeping to not freak out other passengers.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157188.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Not a secret - but if you’re nice you can get quite a bunch of stuff for free.

Example - I was on a flight home (American Airlines) and there was a baby behind us that was just nooooottt having it. Pretty much cried all the way from Phoenix to Chicago. I felt awful.

I was in the aisle, and saw that both the parents were taking turns walking around with the baby. So I asked them if they wanted something drink or a snack…I figured even the human interaction would be nice.

I ordered them something and just went back to my movie. A few minutes later - I got a tap on the shoulder and got a little goodie bag with some treats, and drinks and a little voucher for 24 hour** access to the AA lounge.

Be nice people - it pays off!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157182.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Flight attendants get equally if not more annoyed when flights are delayed. A lot are paid only for the flight time - meaning they arent paid to sit at the airport to wait....or even to greet customers during onboarding...

For that reason alone, the longer the flight the better. Imagine working on a short route where your actual work is 3-4h but youre paid for 55 minutes as that was the duration of the flight.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157189.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Not a flight attendant, but used to be a supervisor for a major US carrier. We had an employee whose child had a science project about germs. She brought her kid in on an overnighted aircraft and they took samples from all over. The galley, lavoratories, seats, tray tables, just about everywhere. The area with the most amount of fecal matter was the tray tables. Yep. I also never drink anything that is never sealed because I have witnessed cleaners who clean the lavoratories then jump to the galley without changing gloves.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157190.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. My friend is a flight attendant, she told me they change their emergency code words every few months. Once an emergency code word (could be something like “marvellous”) is used by a crew member when speaking over PA to pilot, pilot will automatically lock cockpit and not open the door again no matter what.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157191.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. The Galley!

Not a Flight Attendant but exEngineer and trust me, if the aircraft galley were inspected like any other food business it would be condemned within the first trolley!

That’s excluding the dirty water tanks and cleaning crew using one rag from ceiling lights to floor trim.

If you ask anyone who maintains aircraft, you bet they’re buying their meal at the airport.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157192.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. The flight attendants already know what you are going to say. Every joke, come on, request, complaint. They KNOW you are going to say that thing. If this is their 3rd flight of the day, they’ve heard it 6 times already.

No one is clever on an airplane.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157193.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. You have a set limit of how many hours you can fly, and you need 12 hours of rest between duties, ive once seen a pilot Wait 2 unnecessary minutes to turn off the engine to make the flight attendant out of hours for the next day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157194.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I used to work as a flight attendant and Ive seen a lot of stupid and crazy [stuff]. The alcoholism, drug abuse and depression is common in the domain. Its hard for a lot of people to live a superficial life. Its fun at first to see new places and new destinations. But at some point rome or new delhi is just another place at work. Sound downing but Ive seen a lot people complain about this and me as well.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157195.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Former flight attendant here. First of all I’d like to say that everything varies from airline to airline and country to country. I worked for a Latin American airline. The environment was quite toxic, there was A LOT of harassment from the pilots and copilots.. some of them would abuse the position of power they had to make some indecent proposals to the air hostesses. Maybe this is not a secret but for me it was a shock when a pilot (aged 40+) would text me during my days off to hang out (I was 19), I don’t even know from where he got my number and I felt very uncomfortable around him. This was nothing in comparison to other things that many of us experienced.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157196.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. There is an alarming amount of things that can be broken/inop on a MEL (minimum equipment list) and the airplane can still fly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157197.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Pilots are on their phones or reading the newspaper all the time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157198.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. FA here... crop dusting. Basically farting whilst we walk down the aisle due to the bloating. If you fly frequently theres a high chance an fa has farted right by your head as they walked down the aisle.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157199.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. The toilets are near where we sit, and no matter how hard you try to cover the fact that you’re taking a dump. It makes a different noise than if you just go number 1.

No matter what stupid thing you see or read about getting a free upgrade 99% of the time it’s all bollocks.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157200.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. The only dirty thing about my job was the airplanes. they never wash the floors, the seats. it’s gross.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157201.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. We have a list with every passenger’s full name and seat number. Sometimes when we’re bored we’ll Google you.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157202.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. I buddy of mine has been a pilot for the better part of 30 years and says that back 15-20 years ago the Russian/Soviet pilots and crew had to been watched like hawks (sometimes even being locked in a room) because there was a high chance of them getting absolutely s**t faced before when they were supposed to fly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157203.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. This little secret has been in the news lately, pilots and flight attendants are usually only paid when the aircraft door is closed. I am a flight attendant for a regional carrier get paid per diem, about two dollars an hour from the moment we sign in until the moment our trip is finished. However, our hourly rate is only paid when the doors closed.

While the hourly rate might sound good ($20-50+ depending on carrier and seniority) we are typically only paid 75 to 85 hours a month.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157204.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Flying isnt glamourous, one of my friend got spit on and cornered by a passenger and the company and the police did absolutely nothing about it. Also have heard of a few pilots trying to get sexual favors in flight, to no avail (from my knowledge).</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157205.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Pilot is sleeping and co-pilot is flying and there are [passed away] bodies in the cargo.

Source: my mom who is a former flight attendant.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157206.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. With South African Airways, it was the fact that flight attendants were stealing from people’s bags.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157207.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Theres a special frequency called Guard that all aircraft are supposed to monitor. Its for emergencies, or for when an aircraft ends up on a wrong frequency and the controllers need to get contact with them to change them to the right frequency.

Its full of pilots meowing at each other, and people accidentally asking for gate assignments and making other radio calls.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157208.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Sex isnt really that common in flight (ldmcr is too small to do naughty stuff)... but in hotels it happens... and its usually the copilot doing naughty stuff</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157209.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. My roommate’s a flight attendant and she says the flight crew (including pilots) often stays at the same hotel and parties together, and that the pilots often sleep with flight attendants regardless of marital status. Idk if that counts as a secret of the industry, but she says it is.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87157210.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

She always had great stories about her travels and generally spoke positively of every country she visited. The one time I really remember her speaking negatively, or saying she didnt like a location was about India. It was something about the extreme wealth juxtaposed with extreme poverty and slums right next to each other. However, Im not sure when she traveled there.
