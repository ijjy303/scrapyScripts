<span style="font-size:4em">10. PT BARNUM.

Most people know but due to the romanticization of The Greatest Showman, people should know that he was a maniac that did an ungodly experiments on living beings, locked people in cages, abused them, and mocked them. All whilst earning pocket from them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155850.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Einstein wasn’t a great guy. Brilliant, sure, but kinda douchy in his personal life.

He refused to marry his long time lover for years, even after she got pregnant. The child was assumed to be given up for adoption, but no record has ever been found.

He and his wife, Mileva Marić, worked together on their research. People saw them do it. They made jokes about it at parties. He proudly told people that she did all his calculations. They only put his name on their work and he went on to claim all the credit - ignoring any work she had done. Part of their agreement was that she would get the Nobel prize money but he tried to prevent that.

She raised two children - one schizophrenic - took care of the house and tutored to bring in extra money because he couldn’t get a job for a long time. He started getting more notoriety and then began an affair with his first cousin.

He moved to a different country to be with his new hillbilly mistress. He divorced his wife and quickly married the new, younger model. He had rules she had to abide by, such as leaving the room immediately when told and not expecting or asking for any sort of affection except when necessary for appearances sake.

Elsa, his second wife, was dying and he worked nonstop because he didn’t know what to do (I guess). She was basically abandoned her last few months.

He cheated on both his wives, numerous times. Ignored his children. Oh - and he was pretty into his second wife’s daughter and thought about marrying her instead.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155851.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. King Edward the VIII was a nazi sympathizer who possibly colluded with the Germans to retake the throne in the event of an invasion and conquest of Britain.

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Oliver Cromwell

Tried to make England a republic, ended up being a king in all but name. Butchered the Irish, banned Christmas and is partially responsible for the puritans (who fled to America after the monarchy was restarted)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155854.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Coco Chanel was a goddamn Nazi spy. Yes, she was an incredible designer, and shes probably one of the most influential humans of the 20th century, based on the number of people who have worn clothing directly inspired by her over the past 100 years. She really did change the way women dress in a truly radical way, and I respect that - knitwear, feminized menswear, ditching the corset, transforming black into an everyday color, the essential skirt suit, costume jewelry, synthetic fragrances in perfume, the list goes on.

But she was a goddamn Nazi spy. Coco was a wretched anti-Semite, like so many other members of the European elite during the 30s. She dated a number of staggeringly wealthy British aristocrats and theyd all sit around talking about the Protocols of Zion and s**t, trying to figure out whether any members of the royal family were secretly Jews, etc. When war broke out, the two Jewish brothers who ran her perfume empire (aka Chanel No 5, the best selling perfume in the world then and now) had to flee to the US for safety. How did Coco respond? By writing to the Nazis to ask them to transfer ownership over to her, a good Aryan, so she could make more money. But thats not the half of it.

She fell in love with a dashing German spy named Spitz whod been seducing bluebloods all over France and England for years leading up the war. Coco was a useful woman - she was simply one of the richest women in the world, and she knew everyone in the British aristocracy, including her old hunting buddy and dear friend, Winston Churchill himself. She and Spitz socialized with all the biggest Nazi names in town, especially Otto Abetz, the Nazi ambassador to France, who invited them to every party in town. Spitz convinced her to join the Abwehr (aka the German secret service) and make trips to Spain. Operating under the code name Westminster, she attempted to broker a separate peace between Germany and England. (In the meantime, she may or may not have reported at least one woman at the Hotel Ritz whom she suspected of being Jewish to the SS.) She had a grand old time going on her adventures, and wrote about the excitement of working for the Abwehr in her private notes.

Chanel was arrested only a few days after the liberation of Paris - absolutely everyone in town knew what shed been doing and who shed been doing it with - but for rEaSoNs UnKnOwN she was released without charges. Its widely believed that Winston Churchill personally intervened. It might be because the two of them had been close friends for decades. It might be because she was going to embarrass the s**t out of Britain by outing all the anti-Semites and pro-Nazis in the British aristocracy - including the recently abdicated Edward VIII who used his f***ng honeymoon as an excuse to tour Nazi Germany and shake Hitlers hand. She spent the rest of her life being a nasty, bitter morphine addict living in the Hotel Ritz. The House of Chanel has very, very little to say about the matter, and every few years a few more bits of damning evidence are declassified from the vaults.

If you want to learn more, I did a whole episode about her Nazi days in my French history podcast: The Collaborator</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155844.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Kinda coming much more into light now but The Founding Fathers, all of them owned slaves and by modern day standards they would be horrible people. But something I think lots of people don’t remember is even if these things are utterly reprehensible, everyone was doing it and they were all children of their time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155857.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Benito Juárez

He was the type of president who kills his opposition instead of negotiating. He did a lot of illegal executions.

He was going to be executed in Guadalajara, however one of his ministers convinced the soldiers not to kill him with a famous phrase alto, los valientes no asesinan, the soldiers forgave his life and risked theirs as the disobey an order. Well, as soon as Juarez returned to Mexico city, he immediately ordered to kill all of those soldiers with no mercy (source: my sister worked with the Sargents descendant)

After Juárezs government, theres a period Known as the porfiriato, where Porfirio Díaz was Mexicos president for 30 years. It was possible just because there was no opposition alive

Juarez suddenly died in 1872 from a heart attack. Its believed that a woman, to avenge his husband, worked on his home as a maid, and when she had the opportunity, she put an infusion of veintiunilla a herb known by the natives for being poisonous and cause a heart attack 21 days (veintiún dias) after it was drank</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155858.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Churchill. He started the Bengal Famine which killed 3 million people. He also was incredibly racist and liked killing through gas.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155859.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Not quite beloved, but Joseph P. Kennedy Sr..

He decided that Rosemary (his daughter) who was 23 at the time should have a lobotomy; he did not inform his wife of this decision until after the procedure was completed. And then they sent her away to an institute.

In her early young adult years, Rosemary Kennedy experienced seizures and violent mood swings. In response to these issues, her father arranged a prefrontal lobotomy for her in 1941 when she was 23 years of age; the procedure left her permanently incapacitated and rendered her unable to speak intelligibly.

Sick f**k, who would do this to their own child.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155860.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. William Hurt. I remember seeing tons of praise for him when he passed recently.

Thing is, he beat and raped Marlee Matlin back in the 80s. She discussed it in her memoir. When he was approached about it, his response wasnt to deny it, but to apologize for any pain he may have caused to her.

If you want to praise his acting, fine. But remember what sort of person he was behind the characters you loved on film.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155861.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Joseph Smith-

I grew up LDS and left with my family when I was in junior high. After some reading and learning from historical documents without church bias, I realized how drastically different he was when he wasn’t viewed in the eyes of the church.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155862.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Dr Suess cheated on his partially disabled wife and she eventually committed suicide because of how distraught she was.

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Margaret Sanger was pro-eugenics and a racist.

In promoting birth control, she advanced a controversial Negro Project, wrote in her autobiography about speaking to a Ku Klux Klan group and advocated for a eugenics approach to breeding for “the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extinction, of defective stocks — those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.”

She is seen as a saint to many.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87155864.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

She visited something like 166 countries in her life. She was a highschool teacher and would travel every summer, even after she retired she traveled all the time. She always had great stories about her travels and generally spoke positively of every country she visited. The one time I really remember her speaking negatively, or saying she didnt like a location was about India. It was something about the extreme wealth juxtaposed with extreme poverty and slums right next to each other. However, Im not sure when she traveled there. Most of her travelling was between the 1950s-2000s.” - tenaciousE56</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87158871.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
