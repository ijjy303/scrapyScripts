###### 1. Lorenzos Oil is a hard film to watch because its about a child whos dying of an incurable genetic disorder, it sticks pretty closely to the medical facts of the case its based on, and it unfolds from the parents point of view. Harrowing stuff even though the story isnt totally bleak and it was nominated for awards. -u/doublestitch

###### 18. I watched Event Horizon as a 15-year-old who had been left alone for the weekend for the first time at about 11pm on a Saturday night. That was over 20 years ago and Im still not really over it. -u/Grenache<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87127982.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

###### 19. Pan’s Labyrinth. Not necessarily the fantasy part of it, but the main antagonist (Vidal) and the ending. Just horrific. I cry every time. Also, for context, the scene with the Pale Man even scared Stephen freaking King, the reigning king of literary horror. It’s a fantastic and beautiful film but it’s not for the faint of heart.
