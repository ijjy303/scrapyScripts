## <a href="#linky4" id="linky3">30 Trashy Things People Have Seen At Weddings</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I was actually the bartender but it was a hoot. 1st, wedding was outside and it stormed violently. Groom was hammered pre wedding. Hit on all the bartenders. Then the DJ got hammered, made lewd comments to women in the microphone. Then basically everyone was hammered, knocked over the wedding cake which also happened to be a table with many candles, so the place caught on fire. Good times. Often wonder how that marriage worked out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143683.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. The best man screwed the grooms mother between the meal and the dancing. The groom finds out and punches the best man, breaking his hand. The best man drives away and gets stopped by the police for drunk driving.

Being a wedding photographer is awesome.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143682.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Camo print wedding dress that was borderline see-through. Walked down the aisle to the Scooby Doo theme. No, nobody knows why they chose that song, including the couple themselves. They divorced a few months later after they both stopped cleaning the house in an act of defiance against one another.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143684.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. My own. In a Mississippi judges office with a bag of Cheetos on her desk. She wiped her hands on a napkin, grabbed a Bible, and did her thing with orange crumbs on her lips. Her work heels were not on because she was in her office. It was extremely rush. I understand that she was on her break but we didnt mind waiting. Idk why they rushed us thru.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143685.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. A wedding where they had a flag that said “I had my wedding on Friday because Saturdays are for the boys”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143686.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The mother in law took a swing at the bride on the dance floor. Still blows my mind thinking about it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143687.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. A wedding on the beach behind Hooters. The officiant stood next to a trash bin. As if it was planned, the trash collector pulled up during the vows. Did he wait to change the bag? Absolutely not. Children at the wedding swarmed the couple like the flies around the trash can just after the kiss, stepping all over her dress. She bent over to adjust her sandal and a pack of Marlboro reds fell out of the bust along with her right breast.

It felt like we were rubber necking instead witnessing a marriage.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143688.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I don’t even know where to begin.. ceremony was comprised of immediate family then followed by a reception with all guests in a relatively nice hotel banquet hall. An hour in at 7pm the open bar was completely closed down because MULTIPLE guests were throwing up in the bathroom sinks causing flooding, the groom was so wasted even before the ceremony but was blackout by the time of reception. During the first dance he kept his hands in his cargo pant khakis the entire time and ate dinner sitting on the floor in a corner of the hall while the bride sat at the head table alone. About two hours in, the groom randomly left and slept at their house while the bride stayed in the newlywed suite by herself.. they are now separated as you may have assumed by this point.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143689.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Grooms best man went around with a naked photo of the groom. Showed everyone including the bride and grooms family. The worst part was there were kids at the wedding including the brides very young son and it wasnt a small photo either like on his phone it was a huge canvas of the groom nude.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143690.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I used to work at a place that had a very large tent-like building that was often used for weddings, receptions, celebration of life events, etc. It was on a local lake in a beautiful area. It was very expensive to rent out ($3,000-$5,000 depending on how much work from staff is required). Well one family rented it out for the trashiest wedding I had encountered there.

The wedding was peacock themed and the decorations consisted of black and teal paper plates, random peacock feathers, and teal paper cups. They wanted to put all this stuff out the night before the wedding. The owner warned them that this is basically a tent on the lake and things left out will get dirty and spider webbed overnight. They ignored this advice and then pitched a fit when they returned the next morning.

Next, the bride had neglected to try her dress on since she purchased it and had gained weight. She couldnt zip it. She ended up buying a white tank top to wear under it and left it unzipped.

Then after the ceremony, everyone was very inebriated and the brides mother set up a chair on the middle of the dance floor had the groom sit there and cheered her daughter on as the bride gave the groom a very very vigorous lap dance.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143691.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Wedding was in a suburban driveway. The maid of honour stole the bouquet from someone’s garden and the best man proudly announced he had shoplifted the rings. The groom wore a button-down shirt that said ‘f**k off’ in fancy lettering. The bride stopped in the middle of the vows to tell her mother to ‘get that [friggin] kid out of here.’ It was her second kid by the previous bloke.

When it was over, we apologized to the celebrant. He said he’d seen worse.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143692.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. A friend of the family is a wedding photographer. We went to dinner with her family a few weeks ago and she explained the most bizarre wedding she had ever been to (which happened to be that same day, and involved someone we all know)

Wedding was behind a trailer in a trailer park

Folding chairs clearly labeled Property of [school], there were two church pews, and several 5 gallon buckets turned upside down

Some of the wedding party arrived on riding mowers

The bride was wearing some screen-printed t-shirt, jeans, and a veil made from cheesecloth

The groom was wearing a jean vest with no shirt underneath and torn jeans

The bride had met the groom just over 3 months prior, as the groom was still married to his 1st wife at the time. Divorce takes 90 days here. Do the math.

Most of the guests were dressed like they were in the middle of doing yard work

Reception was in the same area. Several cases of PBR and Miller Lite, supermarket pre-boxed cheese and cracker spreads, and a few Bojangles fried chicken boxes</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143693.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. A family member of mines 2ND wedding reception was held INSIDE a indoor gun range. The groom was obviously an avid hunter because the entire wedding party was wearing camouflage suits and the bonus was the open bar consisting on two kegs of coors light sitting trash cans filled with ice.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143694.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Both of my middle sisters weddings.

Dont get me wrong, shes the sane one of my sisters and I actually really love her, but she has a, shall we say, unique sense of style.

Wedding #1 was while she was working as a carnie, and was held after closing time on the midway at some podunk county fair. I may well have been the only sober person there, and there were definitely more tattoos than teeth in attendance. She wound up leaving him when he turned out to be an abusive self-centered twat who contributed nothing to taking care of their kid.

Wedding #2 (just last year) was mostly okay, and BIL is a really stand-up guy. But yall, the whole wedding theme was camo. My sister wore a camouflage wedding dress and matching crocs. BIL wore jeans and a dress shirt with a camo vest. The frigging cake was covered in camo-patterned ribbons and IDK where the hell she got camo patterned silk roses but the cake had a pile of those too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143695.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Ceremony was in a park - not booked or decorated, just showed up and found a spot.

Reception was at a scout hall. No decorations again, and for catering the brides family went through Red Rooster drive thru and got a bunch of whole chickens and chips. Like, 5 different cars went through one after the other and ordered, they didnt even pre order.

Groom and all his friends were high as kites and only reason bride wasnt is because she announced she was knocked up.

Groom and his mates bought their dirt bikes and after eating went out and rode them around the hall. Was so loud and muddy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143696.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. The bride made a speech thanking her in laws for financial assistance for the event. Her mother was not thanked and she was furious. There was a long head table for bridal party and parents. It was made out of small tables pushed together covered by one long tablecloth. The mother pulled a small table out of the arrangement, catching the table cloth, and nearly destroying the head table set up. Now the bride got angry and there was much back and forth with various family members attempting to make peace. The mother refused to push back her table and began to invite others to sit with her, all people who were not meant to be seated at the front. Mother of bride continued to sit there and talk s**t about her daughter, the bride, to anyone who would listen.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143697.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. The bride and her sisters did a strip tease/lap dance on the groom immediately following dinner. In front of his grandmother.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143698.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. My friend group and I talk about this wedding to this day, and probably will for the rest of our lives. The bride and groom decided to do things on a very, very small budget. Thats fine! Frugal weddings and budget weddings can be beautiful and nice! There is a difference between a frugal wedding and a cheap wedding, however, and this was cheap. For instance:

- The wedding was in July. They decided to hold it in a non-air conditioned park shelter.

- The decorations were actual trash. The bride decided me and the other bridesmaids needed tiny top hats, which she made from discarded styrofoam cups. Mine had ants in it.

- She asked me to be the MOH. I was flattered but confused. Shed had three MOHs before me, and they all quit for various reasons, mostly baby daddy drama related.

- She wanted live music but wouldnt pay a pianist. My friend Stephens sister said shed play the wedding march on a keyboard for 50 bucks. Said sister couldnt actually play the piano, but she did the prerecorded wedding march song. Nobody could tell the difference because the woman in charge of baking the cake got [drunk] the day before and was baking the cake in the non-air conditioned park shelters little kitchen while listening to the radio. Very loudly.

- The bride and groom tried to write their own vows, got in a fight over it, and didnt tell the officiant until the day of that there were no vows. Fortunately, he was on it and had backup vows ready to go.

- The bride hadnt tried on her dress, which shed bought from aliexpress, until the day of. It was way too small and we had to rip out the back and safety-pin in some satiny white fabric... which would have been great, if the dress hadnt been off-white. The groom made comments and it turned out that the whole dress thing was based on his mom offering to pay for the dress, then rescinding because she had to bail out his brother. My friend, instead of going to an actual store and buying a dress, picked one off of aliexpress.

This would have been less weird if I hadnt been dress shopping with her like, three times because her mom couldnt/wouldnt pick out a mother of the bride dress.

- The grooms ENTIRE FAMILY including his best man and his two groomsmen left right after the meal (spaghetti, green beans, and McDonalds orange drink) was served. The DJ (my friend Stephen and his Bose speakers) didnt know this and tried to announce the grooms dance with his mom... his mom had left. Apparently his family was furious that it was a dry venue. The only member of the family left was the ring bearer... who it turns out was forgotten. We had to take him home because his family wouldnt come get him.

- The groom slept through the rehearsal and showed up to the wedding drunk.

- We had to put another friend on bouncer duty because two of the brides aunts tried to walk away with the cash envelope. We gave him the envelope because he was the tallest and we figured he could outrun the aunts.

- The brides brother was originally on envelope duty but we caught him taking a 50 out of the envelope, so we had to take it from him.

- We had to politely inform the best man he couldnt smoke in the portajohn.

- We had portajohns instead of actual working bathrooms.

The worst, though, was the photographer. As MOH, I was informed day of that I had to keep the photographer 100 feet away from the ring bearer and flower girls at all times. He was a registered sex offender, but also the brides uncle, and he volunteered to do the pictures for free, so... he ended up using a telephoto lens. Because he couldnt get close enough to the wedding party to take the pictures.

They divorced a couple months later after the house they were staying in burned to the ground. I have no idea to this day why they even got married.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143681.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. It was at a Holiday Inn, the groomsmen all were brightly colored prom vests and jeans. I was a +1 to one of the bridesmaids, I just wore a regular suit, nothing fancy. I was still dressed better than the groom and I got dirty looks for it</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143699.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. I worked at a high-end golf club in Seattle that held extravagant weddings on a regular basis. This wedding in Samoa is perhaps my favourite:

-All of the guys wore lime green vests and snapbacks that matched.

-As mentioned in the contract, the wedding party must order food from the golf clubs restaurant. Instead, they order Dominos, and the pizza delivery man serves them pizza while they sit in a beautiful restaurant.

-Right before the marriage, the bride and broom groom had a fistfight, which caused the ceremony to be postponed until bruises could be concealed with cosmetics.

-A live band was engaged to perform at the event, but they were not fed. The lead vocalist decides to speed down the hill during their first break to fetch a drink.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143700.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. There were no tables and chairs. Like none. They had an open bar but no chairs. Everyone had to put their drink on the ground and hold their plate to eat. It was crazy.

Everyone just assumed that some sort of terrible thing happened where the tables and chair people didnt bring them but afterwards I asked her (the bride) what happened and she just said Oh we would have had to pay extra for that.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143701.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. A friends wedding. She was walking down the aisle and had to pause to put out her cigarette. It was a small wedding and her friends thought it was hilarious. Married less than 2 years. She married him because he was in the military and she thought she was getting cash for life. He chose deployment to a war zone over staying with her.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143702.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. I had one of my friends from highschool get married in a trashy way. His fiancé at the time invited him to lunch at Buffalo wild wings and she had also invited the whole family (they where in on it) and once my friend showed up he found out it was a surprises wedding (just like you would do a surprise birthday party) The even trashier part is they didnt like reserve the restaurant or anything so in his wedding photos (standing in front of the bathrooms by the way) you can see complete strangers coming out of the bathrooms.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143703.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. a coworker of mine got married in her driveway. on the invitation it said that everyone had to wear the color purple and they served KFC and hostess cupcakes for dessert. music was a boom box with the local light rock station playing. the worst part was that she let her dogs crap all over the driveway during the reception so no one ever picked up the poop. we all just kinda weirdly hopped around it in our variety of purple hues.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143704.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Half Mormon half not Mormon wedding. The Mormon half was ultra Mormon, the non-Mormon half was a good amount recovering addicts. The mother got her daughters attention by just standing in front of whatever she was looking at including the groom, the photographer, the DJ, didn’t matter. Mom was also pretty high most of the wedding. 22 people in the bridal party, only 2 girls were the brides bridesmaids from before she met the Mormons. They kept getting frustrated because the Mormon bridesmaids kept pulling the bride away from them whenever they saw them all together alone. No alcohol served so the non-Mormon side went to the liquor store across the street and served their own. Cake smash fail, went straight into the bride’s hair. Mormon side started to talk crap about the drinkers and so the drinkers tried to pick fights with the Mormons. Wedding ended early, lots of tears. Such a hot mess wedding. The couple are both dentists.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143705.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. I went to a wedding in a funeral home once. Drove by it three times before realizing that is was in fact the correct address for the venue. Reception and ceremony were there.. completely dry wedding too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143706.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. I went to a wedding that had a Matrix theme. The groomsmen all wore floor length leather jackets and tiny sunglasses. The MC made a slideshow of images from the movie with the groomsmen’s faces badly photoshopped on. They insisted on calling each other “Neo” and “Amorpheous” while high-fiving each other. It was painful.

There was a lot of tension at the wedding and it turned out that the groom had cheated on the bride a few weeks earlier but she had still decided to marry him. His family was really trashy and took the view that their son had cheated because the bride wasn’t good enough for him. The bride’s family was not trashy but pissed that she took him back and obviously hated the groom and his [lousy] family. The sister was the maid of honour and her speech was very sarcastic “just so glad to welcome you to the family… Greg” but it went over the head’s of the groom’s relatives. Everyone who knew the story was cringing.

The groom’s Dad was loaded. He stood up and told a long and convoluted story about a wife giving teaspoons of sugar to God which made no sense and seemed to have very sexist undertones. They cut quickly to the music and the drunk groom’s father hit the dance floor and started grinding with some woman who wasn’t his wife. His wife sees and has a s**t fit and starts screaming at him. They won’t stop fighting so they cut the music and have the four piece, high school band play classical music badly. It includes a squeaky clarinet.

Like a terrible foreshadowing from above, it starts pissing with rain and people start trying to politely leave. Last thing I see, is the groomsmen running to their cars with their trench coats folded up over their heads to protect their tiny sunglasses, while the band plays the squeaky Matrix theme song. It was amazing.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143707.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. The bride had a little too much to drink. She was on her hands and knees throwing up on the front lawn of the reception hall while people were arriving.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143708.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. I got married at a drive through in Las Vegas. The only photo I still had my seat belt on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143709.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. Im so glad I can share this story again.

In my early 20s a childhood friends sister was getting married. I was friendly with the family and all the siblings so I agreed to go. When I got the invitation it said on the invitation no gifts please just money. This didnt seem like the bride. She would be fine with either. I then get contacted by brides mother who tells me to get them a physical gift because the grooms mother is planning on taking any money they get as compensation for planning the wedding.

I get to the venue which is a church but the wedding is not actually in the main part of the church. It is in the church basement. So bizarre. It looks like the set up of a high school dance. My friend whos sister is getting married tells me that her sister never got her dress altered so they had to use safety pins. They walk down the aisle to a Metallica song playing on a boom box.

The ceremony was quick thankfully. No alcohol at the wedding. Ok, it is what it is. There was sparkling 99 cent grape juice at each table. I know it was 99 cents because the stickers were left on the bottles. Brides mother comes over to me and said I wouldnt eat the food. It was actually food that was supposed to be for meals on wheels and some of it was frozen leftovers of food that wasnt used. This was the grooms mothers idea since she was paying for the wedding.

I gave the bride and groom my gift. They said thank you and seemed perfectly happy with getting a physical gift. Grooms mother comes over to me and asks me why I didnt get them cash or a check for a gift. That it said that right on the invitation. I played dumb and said I must have missed that. She was pissed.

Lastly there was a guy there who took a liking to me. He was dressed in a white tank top, backwards hat and sweatpants. You know, some proper wedding attire... He told me he just got out of jail for drugs and that the bloods and the crips wanted him in their gangs. I told him thats interesting because hes white and I thought they didnt usually recruit white guys. He said they just really wanted him and that he hung out with black people all the time. He then told me that you could cure AIDS by injecting dish soap. It cleans out the blood. He asked for my phone number. I declined. Shockingly the marriage only lasted a few years. Groom has full custody of their two kids because bride is not capable of taking care of their children. She had social services called on her multiple times.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143710.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

They were eventually taken off the market since the glass balls could shatter and kids were getting injured by the flying glass shards. They were a big fad toy for a while there.

Gene complimented my brother highly on his guitar playing but then said too bad youll never make it and just walked away.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144451.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I work for an airline, so I see some celebs from time to time. One time Tom Cruise cussed me out because I wouldnt violate federal law and bring his checked bags to him planeside. Made him go to baggage claim like everyone else.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144455.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Went and saw Steve-O do his stand up tour. After his show, he said he would meet everybody there. We waited in line, and he was being super nice, laughing and taking pictures with everyone. Right before we got to the stage some fat, redneck asshole told him that he was funnier back when he was on drugs. It killed his whole vibe. When we got to him he just took a picture with us and said thanks for coming, but he was clearly in a bad mood. I dont blame him at all, he was still extremely nice, but he was clearly irritated. It was cool that he still met us and took a picture with us though. Seemed like a really cool dude.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144454.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Organized a good sized comic con, so Ive worked with quite a few. But the saddest was really subtle:

Peter Mayhew (chewbacca), was in the green room for lunch on the 2nd day. He looks very tired and is almost totally wheelchair bound because of his terrible joint problems. Im sitting across from him while we eat and his assistant asks if his hand is feeling alright to sign more autographs (terrible arthritis).

He closes his eyes and nods his head and whispers out how much longer will this go today? To which his assistant delicately replies just 5 more hours.

And he whimpers a little and sheds a few tears as they wheel him away from the table and back out to the fans.

The saddest part is that hes the nicest guy and never denies a fan while hes at the con and always smiles even though hes in loads of physical pain.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144444.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I used to go to a small gym. The owners were laid back and had their cats roam around all the time. It was never an issue and people who went regularly would pet them in between sets. My husband and I go to the gym one day. Were the only ones there aside from a trainer in the corner with someone. My husband (a very observant man) tells me to go do some kettle bell swings. I thought it was weird but headed over to the kettle bell section. There is the trainer with Ben Affleck (training for Batman). I didnt want to disturb him, so I completely ignored him. Except its a small gym. So Im working out on the bench next to nice guy Ben, and I can feel him trying to acknowledge me. Suddenly I notice one of the cats starts to pee in the corner next to Ben. I shout NO! to stop the cat, and scoop him up. Ben turns to me and says Hey, is that your cat? Clearly trying to start conversation. I look at him and awkwardly say Its not my cat and walk away. I had an opportunity to talk to Batman and instead became the crazy cat lady. My husband was watching from afar, dying laughing. Now whenever I do something awkward my husband will scream Its not my cat!!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144446.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I became interested in evolution and physical anthropology in high school after exploring the topic in books and discovered Richard Dawkins. I was in the process of reading another of his recent books when I found out he was doing a signing in the city. So I went to his talk and waiting in line to get an autograph.

All through the Q&A session, people had great complex questions for him about his theories and ideas on evolution or certain species. I thought I would be clever and ask a simple and fun question. So in the cover of the book, I wrote, What is your favorite animal? I expected this to be refreshing when he went to sign my book.

I got to the front and as he opened my book to sign it, he was a little thrown off. He gave me a look like I was mentally impaired and just signed his name.

I was crushed and felt really embarrassed that my recent idol thought I was stupid. I wandered off through the racks of books and found a small group of 5 people huddled around one man speaking.

I was curious and still trying to forget my last encounter, so I listened to this energetic man speak about the universe to this impromptu gathering. He was very knowledgeable and interactive. When I got a chance I asked him the same question, Whats your favorite animal? He was very happy with the question and went on a long explanation of why the wolf was his favorite and when he first encountered one in Yellowstone.

I learned later that man was Neil Degrasse Tyson. What a day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144447.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Been waiting for a moment to tell this one. When I worked at a restaurant in Florida a few years ago Muhammad Ali and his family came in to eat. Me being a fanboy and knowing who Ali was kept staring from a distance, and eventually ran next-door to Books A Million to buy his biography King of the World and have him sign it.

As he was leaving I stood and held the door open for them.

His wife was helping him out of the door. He was looking at the ground. No speaking. Slow walking. Shaking from the Parkinsons.

He got to the car and his wife was helping him in. I asked her if I could meet him and have him take a photo and an autograph.

She was delighted and said sure! Cassius, this young man would like to meet you she said. I held out my hand and shook the hand of the greatest Boxer to ever live. The hand that knocked out Fraiser. That mighty right hook.

I immediately started crying. (And tearing up right now). She said dont cry, its okay! I had to explain that its surreal to meet the famous Ali.

She handed him the book and the sharpie and said Cassius he wants your autograph and she opened the book for him and put the pen in his hand. He took at least (no joke) 2 full minutes to sign his name. And it was at that point that it killed me. This was Cassius Clay. Muhammad Ali. The most charismatic, float like a butterfly sting like a bee, man in boxing history. And he was such a shell of his former self because of the Parkinsons. It was so heartbreaking. It really was.

She then took a photo of us together and I thanked him, and her and went on my way.

But god damn that will be the saddest moment meeting a celebrity I think Ill have face.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144448.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I got c*ckblocked by Brad Pitt.

I was an extra in World War Z and I met this girl there and we were talking and all was great until one time Brad Pitt walks by.

Was very friendly to her... totally blanked me.

His stunt double was a cool dude though.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144449.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Betty White. It was right after the Golden Girls (and Golden Palace) had ended. Her career was not in the best place at the time. I was at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles and saw a poster promoting Betty White signing her latest book about how much she loves animals. I liked the Golden Girls so I thought I would swing by the bookstore to take a gander at Betty White. It was so sad. Ill always remember she was sitting alone at a big table with a stack of books in front of her. People were in the bookstore shopping but no one was buying her book or really acknowledging her. She just sat there, pen in hand, waiting. She would occasionally wipe off some imaginary dust to look busy. Im getting the chills just remembering it. Of course, I was such a self-involved college kid that I just stared at her from far away. I should have just gone up and talked to her.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144450.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I was drunk at a friends bachelor party in vegas in 95. We are walking through the casino, and I see this glorious man with what can only be described as the aura of a movie star around him. I immediately recognize him as Sammy Davis Jr. I run up and say Sammy can I get an autograph?! and he just turns around like he didnt hear me and starts walking. Thinking he couldnt hear me I kind of yell Sammy Davis Jr!. He turns around, looks right at me, and says Youre a real asshole.

I was pretty oblivious and had no idea why Sammy Davis Jr. was treating me like I had slapped his little sisters ass. For a few years after that every time his name came up I told people how big of a jerk Sammy David Jr. was. Fast forward to a few years later and Im watching the movie Renaissance Man with Danny Devito and Im like wait I didnt know Sammy David Jr was in this movie ....which caused me to imdb it ...and it all finally clicked.

I had called Gregory Hines Sammy Davis Jr. to his face 5 years after Sammy died. It was probably the most delayed embarrassment Ive ever felt in my life.

tldr: I have no idea what Sammy Davis jr. looks like.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144452.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I met George R. R. Martin at the Blaze Pizza in Evanston a couple of months back when he was in town to accept an award from Northwestern University. At the time, I was listening to the audiobook of A Clash of Kings, and he very excitedly told me, Youve got a ways to go to catch up! When I told him that Ive already read what hes published three times, and am listening to the audiobook as a new way to experience the story, he just kind of ... deflated. He let out a big sigh, and just said, Yeah, I need to finish the next book. People wont stop bothering me about it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144453.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. After Katrina, my now-wife and her then-boyfriend were in Whole Foods in New Orleans, shopping. There was a guy there who looked like Laurence Fishburne, and the boyfriend turns my wife and says, loudly, Damn! Laurence Fishburne got fat!

The man turns around slowly and just stands there, looking at them, forlorn. It was Laurence Fishburne.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144456.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Saw Robin Williams in a bar downtown Toronto. he was so hammered and non coherent. My girlfriend and I tried to speak to him but only slurs and spit bubbles came out of his mouth, he fell on the dance floor twice and looked ready to pass out. To see My childhood hero in such a mess made me really sad. Some girl at the bar was hitting on him then after my gf asked him for a picture.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144457.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. I was working as a concierge at a high end resort in Park City, Utah. Justin Timberlake was staying with us for Sundance, and one of his entourage called the front desk and let us know their internet was being flaky. I was the go-to tech guy, so I ran up to his room and restarted the router for them, and I was hero of the night to everyone in the room. Literally, high fives and chest bumps. As I was riding the elevator down, I heard Timberlake in the garage (great acoustics) BELTING out one of his songs as he was waiting on the lift. The door opened, and we were standing face to face, and I said I dig your sound, man. He looked at me dismissively and said You should. I get paid for it. and walked past me like a schoolyard bully, complete with shoulder bump.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144458.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Met Vince Vaughn in a bar in Hollywood. He was with his entourage or whatever, and had quite a few drinks. He hit on a (girl) friend of mine, and I was amazed to see her totally blow him off. Not that she should have gone for it, but it was pretty incredible to see a multi-millionaire movie star get rejected by an accountant.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144459.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. My saddest celebrity encounter was also my greatest. When I was in college I was an extra in a few scenes of We Were Soldiers, a Vietnam movie with Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott. While I was waiting for a bus to take me back to wardrobe one of the casting guys came up and picked me out of the crowd and asked me if I wanted to be in another scene with Sam Elliott. Of course I was ecstatic. I sat in this van waiting for Sam to come out and it was going to drive us to the scene.

Finally he comes out looking all pissed off and sits in the front seat. Against my better judgement I said something to the effect of, Mr Elliott Im a huge fan of yours and its an honor to be in a scene with you. He snaps back: Shut the f*ck up kid. Needless to say when Sam Elliott tells you to STFU, you do it. So thats the sad part, though getting cussed out by a guy who typically plays the badass in movies was cool in some way.

We film the scene which is a short scene where he walks by Chris Klein and cusses at him about something. We film it over and over and Im just some soldier walking by in the background. Occasionally between takes Sam would look over at me and scowl. After its done we get back in the van to head back and Sam is again in the van. He turns around and says, Sorry about earlier kid, I just didnt want to f*ck up my mood for the scene. I appreciate the compliment. Suddenly it dawned on me that when he cussed at me he was trying to stay in character for the upcoming scene. Pretty cool experience.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144445.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Rachel Weisz. I never let on that I knew who she was and just chatted happily with her as the conversation dwindled and she became more sullen and withdrawn. Finally she snapped at me about something and I immediately sat back and went silent. A couple minutes after, she got up to use the restroom and her nanny leaned over and said simply and quietly, She gets upset if you dont acknowledge who she is.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144460.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Well, I once wanted to get Daryl Hannahs autograph for my friend who had been crushing on her since FOREVER. I couldnt summon up my courage to approach her directly, so I just asked the dude sitting next to her. He put me off very politely.

I went back to my friends emptyhanded and was complimentary of Mr. Nobodys manners. They told me Id just asked JFK Jr for Daryls autograph.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144461.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. My mom found Paris Hilton incognito in an airport, came to find me, brought me to a tiny lady in a hoodie and big sunglasses in the middle of the airport, goes hi are you Paris Hilton? Then pushed me in front of her and said here, say hi to my son! Like I was a weird birthday gift or something.

She said sup. I said sup then she did this weird little laugh. Then my mom goes okay bye!

That was my sad and awkward meeting with Paris Hilton in an airport.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144462.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. DMX very graciously held a door open for me recently. It was a nice encounter until I saw in the news the next day that he had been found unconscious in the parking lot later that evening.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144463.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Met Samuel L. Jackson at a celebrity golf pro am. Shook his hand after I found his ball in the rough and asked him to sign my wallet the one that says BAD MOTHER F*CKER Id bought off eBay since I love Pulp Fiction so much. Had the marker and all. He just said No chance. That feeling of disappointment will be forever with me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144464.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. I was at a cheese shop in the West Village (I realize how douchey this sounds) when I noticed James Spader was at the counter. I was in the middle of a massive Boston Legal binge at the time and absolutely adored his work. So I went to the counter and started looking at the cheese (this is casual, its a cheese shop for f*cks sake). He was sampling cheeses and I just looked at this man whose work I so admired and respected and said hows the Gouda? Apparently its delicious. Stupid. Stupid.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144465.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Eminem. I just think its F*CKED UP he dont answer fans If he didnt wanna talk to me outside his concert he didnt have to, but he coulda signed an autograph for Matthew Thats my little brother man, hes only six years old We waited in the blistering cold for him, four hours and he just said, No.

Gold virginity popped cheers!!!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144466.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Aziz Ansari hit on me years ago and I was too starstruck to remember how to talk.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144467.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
