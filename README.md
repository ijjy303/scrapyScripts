<span style="font-size:4em">1. “The morning after the wedding at campfire coffee the new bride turned to the groom asked, Are you going to wear your ring everyday because it kinda makes you look like a fa**ot? Those of us there side glanced and took deep sips of coffee.. I think it lasted 4-6 months.” - billy_biceps</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185336.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “One of my good friends got married and Id never met her before the wedding because shes just shy. On the wedding day, she was belligerently drunk before the ceremony even started and couldnt even get through the lines she was supposed to repeat (i.e. I promise to love you). She ended up slapping the groom, spilling champagne on her dress, and then crying under a table while he tried to comfort her. They lasted about 4 months.” - irrelevant_usernam3</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185324.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Not the couple getting married but the Best Man and Maid of Honor who were married to each other. Best Mans speech was all about how hard it was to be married. Ive been married for a year and it feels like 100 years. Maid of Honor stands up to give a speech and just says Ditto. It was so awkward and really brought the whole room down. Brother of the bride stood up and gave a nice impromptu speech about teamwork and having a partner to go through life with. How happy the family was to have the groom join their family. Best Man and Maid of Honor were divorced within a year. Couple who got married are still married 30+ years later. I sometimes wonder if the speeches actually were helpful in how not to act as a couple. For me the complex backstory. Brides brother is gay and has been in a longterm relationship for 40+ years. At the time he gave his speech about marriage he couldnt marry the man he loved and I think his passioned defense of marriage was born from that. When people would say they were against gay marriage because it makes a mockery of marriage Id think of that night. The married couple who had no respect for marriage could easily marry (and did over and over again) and the man who stood up and defended marriage could not. Hes married now and lovingly takes care of his husband as he battles health issues.” - designgoddess</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185320.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “A fun light-hearted dance with the groom followed by a close and slow dance with her male best friend.” - codyish</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185331.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “He ended up at the emergency room between the ceremony and the reception. He went out out the night night before with his sister and friends and got plastered. They had to hold a cold pak to the back of his neck to keep him vertical during the wedding photos. Marriage lasted 30 days until they had a fight, she left the house and he filled the U-Haul truck with everything but her clothes.” - blackhart452</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185332.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “When the bride drank vodka out of a pint glass and spent a significant amount of time making out with another guy on the dance floor.” - csdirty</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185335.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “When they were doing the vows and the priest got to the for richer or poorer part and she said for richer or richer and maybe for poorer. The officiant was not pleased. I think they made it a year.” - crm115</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185321.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. “He got so f**ked up at the reception he had a fist fight with her cousin in the toilets over coke. He told all the other cousins to fuck off. He hit on my aunt. He told my cousins child to come back to him when she was 15/16. And he forgot to bring his child to the hotel.” - TheAdminAreEvil</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185333.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “Source: My Wedding. Well start three days before. The wedding was a ren-fair style wedding outside at a large gazebo and the Maid of honor had promised to purchase a stylized dress for my bride that they had agreed on. THREE DAYS before the wedding she calls to tell us she had no money and was embarrased to admit it....so we literally hand-sewed ont together in 24 hours. IMO it turned out pretty nice for what we had… Brides mother was supposed to pick up the cake in ATX and drive an hour south for the wedding. She left her house 30 minutes before the wedding to pick it up. When she finally showed up (hour late) the cake was DESTROYED....she put it in the back seat and drove like hell all the way down, just slamming it against box with every turn. During the one hour delay, there was almost a fist fight between two groomsmen because....well the MoH showed up, IN THE DRESS THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO AFFORD. Obvious attempt to upstage the bride. The same MoH during her speech after the ceremony started it of by saying When we all met, I did not like Drakkarim411 at all, however I found that he grows on you...like a fungus. Needless to say my entire side of the family was super cold to all of this. Since all of these issues were on her side of friendships or families, I was told to suck it up and well discuss later. I sort of assumed that a lot of these friends had just shown themselves the door. Quite the opposite. In fact, two years later when I accepted my first well paying job out of college, it became an issue that it was an hour and a half out of Austin...so she decided to just stay in ATX to be with her friends. ...I mailed her the divorce papers and since she couldnt be bothered to even show up to the hearing....Ive never seen her again.” - Drakkarim411</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185322.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “She told me two days before that she found her fiancé annoying and that she didn’t like him and that he was AWFUL in bed. She was visibly, endlessly uncomfortable at the rehearsal wedding/dinner combo. Then she sobbed the ENTIRE morning, day-of. She ended up not getting any makeup done cause she wouldn’t stop scream-sobbing and refused to get dressed, stalling the wedding ~35 minutes. She then said 45 minutes of “vows” that she had prepared (9 pages of things like inappropriate vows to friends and family, his parents and sisters, none of them her husband), and then ALMOST didn’t say “I do”. Managed to get a, “uh, yeah, okay, yeah I do” out of her almost a full 60 seconds after she was supposed to say anything. I could go on for HOURS, but it was the most painful and awkward wedding I’ve ever been to. I’ve got my money on 10 months. We’re 1 month in.” - brbdead</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185323.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “Another one was my wifes friend. Shes a very conservative, religious white girl who married a black man. Most of her racist family didnt approve of the marriage and didnt show up. But she planned the whole marriage around race. Like a vanilla cake for her and a chocolate cake for him, the wedding colors were black and white, and even the meals were white meat for her side and dark meat for his. It was extremely uncomfortable as a guest. They lasted 2 years (but broke up because he was abusive and almost killed her, rather than the weird racial tension).” - irrelevant_usernam3</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185325.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “Not at the wedding itself, but I used to work at a Davids Bridal. Bride came in with tons of friends, we did the Say Yes To The Dress Thing, and an hour later shed standing there in $3,000 worth of stuff and doesnt have any money with her or in her account. She decides she wants to apply for the store credit card, I run it through the system, and she gets denied. She then calls the groom for his info (which, to be fair, people did all the time), and he tells her no. She threw a HUGE fit on the phone with him, standing on the bridal stage, literally demanding WHY NOT? WHY?! WHY!! like an actual child over and over again. Ive never seen a 30 year old age backwards so quickly. She was just a brat. Literally stomping her feet in front of me, all her friends, and the other bride in the store. *I* was embarassed. At the end of all of that, she hangs up on him and her friend is like Im so sorry you cant get your dress and the bride stops crying instantly and just goes Oh Ill get the dress. I just have to do this at home and when he gets mad enough hell come get it for me so Ill stop. Speechless. Sure enough. Girl came back two days later with her man and he applied for the credit card and bought the dress. He was livid and silent, and she was smug as hell. Cant imagine theyre having a happy marriage if they are still together.” - alsothebagel</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185326.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “I’M WITNESSING ONE FROM THE SIDELINES NOW!!! My wife’s brother just got married this past May. Bride’s mother is a big DIY person and went a little nuts with extra flowers, table pieces, decorations, etc… Note I said extra, it was already decorated by the venue, she just took it upon herself to buy and add way more stuff. Anyway, a few weeks ago she sends my MIL (grooms mom) and email with receipts of all the extra stuff she bought ($7,000 worth!!! ) and asked that she pay half since it was technically set up in time for the rehearsal dinner for guests to enjoy. It’s causing a huge rift between the newlyweds since the bride is taking her moms side.” - WanderingRaindog</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185327.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “My wife got invited to a clients daughters wedding. The couple were both drama students. Many of the bridal party were drama students. The maid-of-honours toast consisted of tearful declarations of unrequited love to the groom, along the lines of if it couldnt be me, Im glad its my best friend thats marrying you. The best-mans speech was a lusty declaration of if it doesnt work out, call me, babe... like the previous time you called me. Other toasts were similarly weird. A guy at the table I was seated at was a friend of the bride and said to me that he was this close to standing up during the speak now or forever hold your peace thing. Im still not sure if the whole thing was a bunch of emotionally fucked-up 20-year-olds, or one big piece of performance art.” - sharplescorner</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185328.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. “When my sister married her first husband she mouthed to my father walking her down the aisle I can make this work, right?... They were divorced 6 months later.... my whole family knew it wasnt a good idea since the original engagement a year prior…” - IMgonnaDIE</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185329.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. “I was maid of honour. Me, best man and the couple went into a separate little room to do the signing stuff. Bride excused herself to go the bathroom and the groom started making pretty mean remarks about her cooking (sth shes passionate about) to the officiary. She came back, heard they were talking about cooking family meals together and gave him the warmest smile, thinking he had praised her. He scoffed awkwardly and changed the topic. That always stuck with me. He wasnt laughing WITH her but AT her, behind her back. They lasted 7 months.” - Kraken_of_BeverlyRd</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185330.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. “Well here it goes…. My cousin got married probably a decade ago and during the wedding it came out that groom was not the best to my cousin while dating. The brides brother did not take this well and during the after party a shouting match became a brawl between the two families. Next thing you know the police show up and literally pepper spray everyone. Including my grandma, kids and anyone near the area. I don’t remember if anyone got arrested but the story got on CBS the early show for the international news. Lol they did not last long to say the least.” - mendoza327</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185334.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. “Groom had surprise gifts scheduled to show up once an hour for the 8 hours prior to the wedding, with special meaning behind each one relating to relevant moments of their relationship. Bride was bitchy because some of them werent up to her standards. Theyre currently in the maybe if we have a baby, the immense increased stress will save our marriage stage.” - CoderDispose</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185337.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. “When the bride tried to playfully feed the groom some cake, pulling it back once it got close to his mouth. The third time she did this, he slapped it out of her hand and stormed off. In the ensuing awkward silence and wide-eyed staring, we all knew it wouldnt last. Surprisingly, they were together for nearly two years before the bride eloped away with her step-brother. No one saw that coming.” - grubychild</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185338.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. “Prior to my wedding I’d asked my husband to practice dancing with me because I’m uncoordinated, due to a disability. He blew me off and said we’d be fine. As we were dancing, he spoke in my ear, not even quietly. “What are you doing? What’s wrong with you? You’re embarrassing me!!” We lasted 2 years. Leaving was the best decision I ever made.” - Edavis050694</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185339.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. “My uncle when he broke his neck trying to breakdance on his stag do, He went down the aisle in a wheelchair. She divorced shortly after. He can walk again now but because of his surgery he cannot turn his neck. One of my go to stories because its insane.” - Byrdie55555</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185340.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. “The groom showed up drunk after golfing with buddies all day. The bride in her vows said For Richer... left out the poorer - kellygrrrl328</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185342.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. “Wedding videographer here, I think my favorite moment was when I was sitting at the miscellaneous table with all the randoms and the girl next to me, the grooms ex, drunkenly admitted to sleeping with the groom a few months prior” - qwertyNopesir</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185343.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. “I worked at a museum that also doubled as a wedding venue in the summers. As part of the wedding package, the museum would stay open after hours for the guests only so I’d just sit there and greet people basically. One wedding got particularly rowdy. Almost everyone was drunk, people were jumping into the fountain, someone vomited in said fountain. At one point, the bride is crying. Turns out the groom and one of his groomsmen were screwing upstairs in one of the bathrooms. A fight ensued between the groom and the father of the bride and cops were called because it really got ugly. Entertaining for me but I felt so bad for the bride.” - lacrimal_</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185344.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Play boardgames and talk, or just watching a movie with a glass of wine/beer. Nothing wrong with a night in, as long as you make it memorable. -Jazz_vE</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87102764.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Didnt really do it because I was out of cash per se, but I went out with a girl I liked in 2020 during a phase of the pandemic where restaurants and cafes were closed. And since it was winter (and where Im from winter is particularly cold) and our plans were to go on a walk in a park, I surprised her by bringing homemade muffins, a thermos full of warm tea and two cups, so we ended up sitting on a bench warming ourselves up drinking tea. I think it applies well for a low-budget date idea, especially if you find a place with a good view like we did! -koorvus</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87102766.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Going to a very specific store - like lighting or carpets - and just asking do you like this one? Why? Always nice and hilarious how I can be surprised up to now.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Sit in separate tiny apartments and have anxiety attacks over webcams. Because we work at different medical practices and actually meeting up would be a terrible idea. -ThadisJones</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87102769.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Look up free events in my city on Facebook Events section and just go there.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Have an at-home spa night - take a bath together, wash each other’s hair, do a homemade face mask etc and give each other massages. Check out your local library. They have amazing resources that you might not expect. My local library system lets us check out aquarium passes, state park passes, telescopes, all sorts of cool stuff and all for free. Plan a dream vacation. Pick an international city and look up landmarks, restaurants, nature spots you’d want to visit. You could even cook a dish from that culture and watch a movie set there. -Alternative-East9418</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87102775.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Witnessed the end of a girl being jumped by about 6 other girls in high school. Dont know what exactly they cut her face with but they tried to cut her eye out and did a pretty close job. Sadly she went blind in that eye. That was sophomore year and she graduated with us as the second highest GPA. The amount of blood that was there and the eye almost hanging out of her skull was just wild to see.

<span style="font-size:4em">15. During 4th grade, my elementary school had a tall rusted fence that blocked the schoolyard from the outside, and some kid tried to climb it to get a ball back. He slipped on top and his arm got stuck by the top of the railing, perforating his arm and cutting it deep almost from wrist to elbow. He collapsed from shock and loss of blood still stuck to the railing. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173583.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Fortunately, the fire department got there in less than 15 minutes and they got the kid out of it, saving him. He has this huge scar on his arm, but its alive, well, and moves his arm well. To this day I cant shake that image out of my mind.

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">30 Moments People Realized They Weren't Getting Paid Enough For This</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Had a guy come in with a raging hard on that wouldnt go away. Priapism for those that enjoy science. I had to hold this guys throbbing boner while a resident stabbed it with needles trying to drain it and inject medications to make it go down. After 8 stabs, no luck. Dude went to surgery and was told he will never have an erection again. I was the last person to hold his functional wiener. PSA- if youve had a four hour long stiffy, get to the ER in a jiffy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184391.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I had to stand there while some lady told me I was incompetent for not being able to make her steak sandwich medium rare.

I was working at Subway.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184411.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Used to work retail security, got threatened by a junkie with a dirty needle over a Friends box set...

That was my last day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184410.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Im a helper for people with mental disabilities.

Have you ever pulled a turd out of a mans a** when he is stuck halfway through his pooping?

Have you ever woken him up to find he has smeared sh*t all over his face like war paint?

Have you ever been jabbed in the eye because you made him eat his vegetables?

Have you ever had to convince someone with paranoid schizophrenia that you were, in fact, real and not a hallucination while they held a knife?

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Worked retail, worked night fill as assistant manager, assistant day manager thought he was gods gift to women.

During stocktake (when both night and day staff are in store) walked in on said manager trying to force himself on a night fill staff member. Pulled him off her, got punched in the face and chest multiple times. filed a police report.

Was then written up for not escalating the incident to upper management instead of reporting the rapist prick to the police. Flipped them the bird and told them to f*ck off. Was really tempted to deck the dude on the way out, but instead went and filed a second police report for assault (on myself) and got his ass fired by regional management who some how knew nothing about this whole thing until the police called them.

Gave up on retail at that point and went back to university.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184384.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Used to work as a paramedic/ER Tech. Had a homeless man come in with a narcotics overdose. He was given Narcan to reverse the effects of the drugs. Safe to say he was not happy. He assaulted one of the nurses which led to him being restrained to the bed. He began screaming at everyone that entered the room that he was gonna kill em. After about 10 minutes of this, he scoots to one side of the bed, and sticks his ass in between the railings. He then projectile sh*ts all over the computer, the walls, chair, and floor. There was just so much poo. I, along with others, had to go in there and clean him/some of the room up. Thankfully housekeeping took care of the floor. I literally said, I dont get paid enough for this sh*t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184385.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. When the lady at the table I was serving complained because the ice in her glass of ice water had melted and the water was too watered down for her liking.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184386.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Me and 3 others got the sh*t kicked out of us in a small horse stall by 5 emus we were trying to deworm. Not worth $8 an hour.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184387.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Right now.. Im on hour 12 of what is shaping up to be a 16-18 hour day, and Im fixing the mistakes of someone who gets paid at minimum 40k more than me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184388.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I worked at a gas station in my teens. Lived on my own, needed the money, and there werent many options in my area for someone my age. Every week Id clock in a minimum of 50 hours and only ever get paid for 30-38 hrs. They kept saying theyd fix it, it never got fixed. I worked double shifts regularly and got called in every single day off I had scheduled. Every one. I couldnt afford caller ID at the time (this was before it was standard) so on my day off, I had to stop answering the phone because simply telling them I couldnt make it in would result in them calling all. f*cking. day. Then, since I lived so close by, they started sending other employees to my apartment. Most of them felt bad about it, and eventually refused but then the manager and district manager started showing up, pounding at my door, pleading with me, slipping notes under my door, and trying to guilt trip and threaten my job safety. I cant even begin to explain the toll that took on me, physically and mentally. I stopped menstruating (TMI, sorry) and actually started losing my hair. But, I needed the money.

My breaking point was shortly after Id already quit once. The first time was because Id requested my birthday off, they approved it, and then the day before told me Id need to come in. I said no and stood my ground. The manager eventually agreed to figure something else out. Birthday comes around and my phone gets blown up by every on duty employee and one off duty. I finally tell the boss they can leave me alone for the rest of the day or I quit. He replies Well... were going to need you to come in still. So I quit. I got rehired the next day after I plugged my phone back in (because quitting didnt stop the calls) by the district manager who begged me to stay and promised to have the store back off when I had a free day.

A few weeks later was Easter. Id surprisingly been given it off, and was excited to finally get to spend a holiday with my family. That morning I woke up to the phone ringing. And ringing. And ringing. It was 6:30 AM. I am not a morning person. I answered, told them no, and ignored the barrage of calls that continued until I went out the door. About an hour after I got to my Moms, the calls started there. Id never given them her number. I refused, asked them not to call there again and hung up. My mom answered and asked them not to call back. My step dad answered and threatened to call the cops for harassment. They wouldnt stop. We had to unplug all the phones for dinner and I was terrified they were going to show up there too. As soon as the phone reconnected, the calls started again. Thats when I finally snapped. I answered and told the boss every possible way to go f*ck himself. He eventually hung up on me so I called his a** right back and continued. I didnt just quit, I unhinged. I kept calling until they took their phone off the hook. Then I (kind of) enjoyed the rest of my Easter evening. Ive had my share of sh*tty jobs before and since, but nothing that compares to that place.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184389.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Mental health nurse here. I witnessed this but it didnt happen to me. One day on shift I responded to a duress alarm on another ward (1 nurse from each ward responds to duress from any ward). A female patient on a psychiatric intensive care unit had become violent and and could not be deescalated. It was decided that physical restraint and intramuscular medication would be needed to settle her down.

Anyway, as the team of 5 nurses approached her she was standing there with her legs apart and shouting at us. Just as we stepped into her space to initiate the restraint she stuck her fingers into her vagina (she was menstruating at the time) and managed to stick them into the mouth of one of the female nurses doing the restraint. The patient was extremely amused. Nurse vomited after the restraint and had to leave for the day.

Thats just one of the really bizarre moments I have experience since working as a mental health nurse.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184390.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. When I had to clean poop of a very confused lady who thought I was forcing her to have an abortion. She was kicking and screaming every time anyone came near her with a wash cloth. When we got her her in the shower room to clean her she was was grabbing hand fulls of her own poop screaming WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BABY.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184392.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. When a thick stream of sweat drained out of this girls cell phone case. I had to explain to her that her phone had water damage and that she shouldnt work out with her phone in her bra, all the while trying to be professional and not gag while cleaning the mess. (I sold phones at Sprint).</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184393.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I was a rookie wild land fire fighter making ten/eleven bucks an hour, and I seriously questioned why I only got paid that much, particularly that one time that I had to hold two hundred yards of road with nothing but a tool, and two other rookies who were pissing their pants, when a wall of flame hit our line and started throwing spots into the tall grass we were standing in. Luckily a brush truck arrived before we lost most of our facial hair, and we made it out alright.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184394.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Library. Found a used nappy (diaper) crammed in behind the books in the picture books area. Not the first time Id found one, but the first one Id found folded sh*t side out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184395.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I worked as a cook at a restaurant that doubled as a night club after dark. A guy got shot and killed on the front landing one night and the next day they expected me to clean up the f*cking murder scene.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184396.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Cable guy here:

You know that really run down trailer park with hundreds of cats running around unchecked outside? The one thats full of rust bucket trucks with confederate flags painted on the tail gate? When the wind blows you are overwhelmed by the scent of cat urine..... I go into those trailers and dig through piles of garbage/diapers/animal and human s**t all because my Fox News pixelated once during the debate only to find the customer had spliced in their own line because they wanted tv in the rest of the trailer. I then have to crawl under the trailer and run a new line to replace the one they f**ked up, all the while being told how Im a piece of sh*t because Im following company policy that you pay for every room you have tv in. Also heres 2 dead cats and a black widow colony that I carefully avoid, until I am backing out (because you dont have room to turn around under a trailer) and my boot goes into the web. I do all of this just so they can have cable for the 3 months until they get disconnected for not paying the bill and switch to dish.

It was a long day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184397.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. When I got texts like these from my boss boss boss.

For anyone (men can get harassed too) facing this kind of harassment, dont quit until you have another job secured, especially if youre reporting it to HR. HR departments from different companies talk to each other, and you will not believe how hard it is to find a job when you have develop a reputation as a trouble-maker, attention wh*re, c*cktease, sl*t, etc. HR is there to protect the company, not you. So no matter how close you think you are to HR, expect some sort of backlash.

The more senior the person is, the more likely they are to have gotten away with this for a looonng time. Theres safety in numbers so if you can find other men/women that have faced the same harassment from the same guy (you will), report in a group and make sure everything is documented. S/he could still get away with it, but itll be harder when theres more evidence. One person can be branded a sl*t but multiple people? HR must have awesome hiring policies.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184398.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. I was working at a gas station on Halloween. Pretty normal night, a bit more beer than usual. And then I see some kid walk by with his collar pulled up, hes walking a little odd. Then he walks back the way he cames which is a little weird. Then I notice his friends walking up. I m looking at them and I see one is wearing a mask. Then I see a fire extinguisher in his hands. I start moving to the switch that controls the electric locks but sadly I reached it half a second too late. Two kids hold the doors open and this little sh*t unloads an entire fire extinguisher into the store. Cant see sh*t, the entire store is filled with powdery haze. It took 8 hours to clean up. Eight hours closed for a 24 hour gas station. And it turns out, the whole point was to steal an 18 rack of f*cking keystone. F*cking kids.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184399.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Accidentally Poking myself with a needle that was just used on an hiv positive person</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184400.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. While working at an adult video store, I discovered a bucket of dehydrated piss in the broom closet. For a moment, I tried to summon a normal reaction of disgust or anger, but I felt nothing but indifference. The piss bucket wasnt what broke my spirit.. it was what made me realize I had no more spirit to break.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184401.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Was flying a jet full of tech people to SXSW. 8 Seats on the plane and they were all full. First thing in the morning, the passengers started having drinks. 2 hours into the flight someone taps me on the shoulder and says Captain, the toilet isnt working.

It was working just fine, but the tank was at capacity. We could either land the plane and delay for a while, or they could hold it. Meanwhile, I had to pull on some rubber gloves, grab the knife from the bagel tray, and try to go Super Mario on the airplanes lavatory.

So there I was at 41,000 plunging a toilet with a plastic knife thinking, Im too old for this sh*t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184402.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Was a manager at a McDonalds and I got screamed at by our district supervisor, mid shift, for putting too many ketchup packets in a bag through the drive thru.

F*ck. That.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184403.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. I recently had to climb into a 7ft deep pit that was covered by a grate to remove lead paint from a window. The pit was obviously breeding ground for spiders. There were thousands of them... Thousands..</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184404.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. cleaning diarrhoea off the walls of a bathroom stall 3 times in one night.

(bartender)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184405.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. Im a mental health counselor at an eating disorder facility. We had a new patient arrive who previously came from a sober house and was homeless so he brought all his belongings with him, which was around two large suitcases of clothing. He stayed in program for roughly 36 hours than quickly discharged himself without much of an explanation or plan on what to do (he was from across the country). My coworker and I go into strip and remake his bed, after he had already left, and we find BOXES full of purge (like nature valley boxes but costco size) and one suitcase full of purge and a bunch of clothes still soaking wet, full of purge. Also found some of his purge-covered clothes outside the window, which we went to go dispose of. Those had mats all around them and i learned that maggots show up pretty fast when you leave vomit in 90 degree heat. We both look at each other and were like ....this is waaaay above our pay grade.

I wish that was the grossest story. Just the first one that comes to mind.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184406.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. I was on a phonecall for 22 hours.

Twenty. Two. Hours.

Long story. I was in a security team that did a lot of hand-holding tech-support kinda stuff because we didnt trust anyone. At some point it was a HUGE mess with me being the only guy and me being abused horribly. Eventually my boss and I managed to get some ground-rules in - no upgrades without telling us 3 days in advance. No calling SterlingPhoenix with no good reason. SterlingPhoenix is allowed to hang up on you if you do not give him anything to do, etc.

Then my boss quit, and we got a new boss who didnt enforce anything and did not have my back.

These people set an implementation for like 10pm, and told ME about it at 4pm. Which is way less than 72 hours. I told them hey, tough luck. And my boss goes Oh youre helping them or else.

So I worked with them all night, then they paged me back in the next day, and my boss pretty much threatened to have me continue to work with them (and a lot of this was just me being on the phone and them saying I cant hang up just in case). Finally got to leave at 2am.

...and yet it took me years after that to actually quit.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184407.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. When my assh*le patient pointed his finger at me angrily and said, Your job is to serve me. No one has ever talked to me that way in my life. How dare someone speak to me that way who is depending upon me to make sure they dont bleed out after their heart catheterization and advocate on their behalf to the physicians.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87184408.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
