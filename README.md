<span style="font-size:4em">4. At one point, Ryan Lochte was arguably on the way to becoming as big in the swimming world as Michael Phelps.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch when he said something like “I want cool people to wear our clothes, not fat people” when asked why they didn’t carry any plus sized clothes for women. The term “cancelled” wasn’t really a thing back in 2013 but man did A&F get cancelled HARD after that</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199075.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. That lady that got accepted to the NASA internship, wrote an explicit tweet about it, and when someone told her to watch her language, she told them to STFU.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. My grandpa. For 23 years of my life, I thought he was the most honest and upstanding person I had the honour of knowing. Then last year, I found out he’s always had a habit of manipulating his dying family member’s/friend’s wills into leaving him and his wife the good, expensive stuff (houses, cars, etc). It’s how he’s avoided bankruptcy for so damn long. Selling off these stolen houses to pay for his own. He stole a house out from his own step daughter after her son had been in a near fatal accident, and she herself had just survived a suicide attempt. So yeah. Turns out the best man I know is one of the worst. And what’s better? He passed on his house stealing skills to his cvnt daughter (my aunt). So the cycle continues. Ugh. Sorry for the rant.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199078.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Travis Scott’s apology and behavior during the Astroworld tragedy.

His fans are brainwashed by his garbage music</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199079.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Gerald Ratner

at one time Ratners were a nationwide chain of jewelry shops in the UK, they were known as an affordable jewelry shop.

In 1991 he was a guest at the Institute of Directors and made a speech where he called the stuff sold by his shops, total C**p. A popular range of earrings was described as being cheaper than a prawn sandwich and compounded it by saying the prawn sandwich would last longer.

<span style="font-size:4em">15. There was a PC building company earlier this year that disqualified a prize winner because the company owner thought the winners social media presence was too weak.

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Former Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers baseball player and executive Al Campanis.

He had a brief career as a player with the Brooklyn Dodgers, playing only 7 games with them in 1943, but spent a lot of time in the minor leagues and played one season in the minors with Jackie Robinson the year before Robinson became the first African-American player in the majors. After retiring as a player he became a scout and moved up in the organization to become the General Manager of the Dodgers in 1968.

On April 6, 1987 Campanis was invited to appear on the TV show *Nightline* to be interviewed by Ted Koppel about Jackie Robinson, as April 15th would be the 40th anniversary of Jackie Robinsons first game in the majors and they were good friends until Robinsons death in 1972.

Koppel asked Campanis about why there were so few Black managers and no Black general managers. Campanis answered, I truly believe that they may not have some of the necessities to be, lets say, a field manager, or, perhaps, a general manager. When pressed later in the interview by Koppel, he said Why are Black men or Black people not good swimmers? Because they dont have the buoyancy and also saying that the Black race certainly are short on individuals with strong decision-making capabilities.

<span style="font-size:4em">18. The PR chick traveling to South Africa who tweeted something like, heading to Africa, hope I dont get AIDS. Just kidding, Im white!

Turned her phone off for the flight, and by the time she turned it on when she landed, it had gone viral and, if memory serves, she had already lost her job.

Edit: Quite a few people commenting that she must be awful at her job and/or she should have known better.
1. in the earlier days of social media, it was reasonably expected that your posts would remain private among your network. This is one of the first cases of a non-celebrity post going viral and being publicly shamed for it. There was no precedent. Bad judgement? Of course, but 2013 and 2022 are very different times
2. her ability to craft effective corporate communications is not diminished by the poor judgement mentioned above that she exercised *once*. Presumably, she was hired by other firms (and perhaps rehired by her old firm) not because of her fame, but because she was actually skilled at what she does.

Edit 2: while I havent seen it, the sheer number of references to The Family Guy seems to indicate that yes, they did parody this situation in an episode. Seems like Seth McFarlanes brand of humor.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199091.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Had a supervisor who decided to get blitzed on morphine and alcohol before writing a racist, incomprehensible, unprofessional email and sending it to every subordinate. Every single person turned against him, and he was gone from his job really quickly after that. (And he was tenured and everything).

Cometstarlight replied:

And this is on multiple fronts.

Their industry?

-bugged launches, lying about game content, having games with microtransactions totaling up to over $100,000 as a pay to win scheme

Their actual company?

-Cubicle romps to harass women co workers, the Bill Cosby suite, harassing a woman to suicide, passing over women for promotions because they might get pregnant and take time off work, etc.

There is so, so much wrong with that company and the kicker now is that their in house investigation said they did nothing wrong.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199093.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. Jim Marshall. One of the greatest defensive linemen in NFL football history.

To quote vikings.com : A valued member of Minnesotas Purple People Eaters defensive line, Marshall holds numerous NFL records that include the most seasons played by a defensive player (20, along with Junior Seau and Darrell Green), most consecutive games by a defensive player (282), most consecutive starts by a defensive player (270), and most career fumble recoveries (30). Marshall, who was still a starter at age 42, helped the Vikings win three NFC titles along with the NFL championship in 1969.

However, one day, in one game, Jim Marshall had a quick lapse in judgement and now almost EVERY NFL fan remembers Jim Marshall for one mistake he made: He picked up a fumble and ran the wrong way.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199100.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
