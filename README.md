<span style="font-size:4em">1. R. Lee Ermey, who plays Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket (1987), came up with 150 pages worth of insults for his role. Originally a technical advisor for the film, he took over after the original actor tired himself out after yelling for 30 minutes.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139612.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The Terminator (1984) During the scene where Terminator is removing his eye with an x-acto, there is no blade visible when he brings the knife to his eye</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139614.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The Predator (1987), the character of Predator was never meant to make the distinctive clicking sound.

<span style="font-size:4em">8. In The Terminator (1984), the T-800 has human teeth, likely since this would be the only part of the endoskeleton visible.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139619.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. In Top Gun (1988), the term “bogey” is misused throughout the movie. A bogey is an unidentified aircraft.

<span style="font-size:4em">15.

<span style="font-size:4em">17. In Die Hard (1988), Alan Rickman’s Petrified Expression While Falling Was Completely Genuine. The Stunt Team Instructed Him That They Would Drop Him On The Count Of 3 But Instead Dropped Him At 1</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139627.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. In Terminator 2, the man taking the photos of the T-800 was the cop that the T-800 assaulted in Terminator 1.

<span style="font-size:4em">19. In The Terminator (1984), James Cameron directed Schwarzenegger to move his eyes independently from his head while searching for his target, because it would conserve energy — a reasonable priority for a machine.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139630.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20.

## <a href="#linky12" id="linky11">34 People Who Have Been Banned From Somewhere</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I was banned for life from attending Late Night with David Letterman because I cancelled my reservation. I guess it was hard to find people for the audience in freaking New York City? The intern (I assume) who I talked to was very serious: “You should know if you cancel you will never be allowed back. Ever!”

Somehow I got over it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145305.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. My college roommate got permabanned from Target for putting Wet Floor signs next to the 50 Shades of Grey display.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145298.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Im banned from a cafe in a town in North Wales; neither of which Id been to prior to this experience. I walked in and the guy behind the counter said You! Ive told you before! Youre banned! I said, confusedly Ive never been here before, but he just pointed at the door, so I turned around and left. Almost 30 years ago.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145299.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. In college, at the local college book store, I attempted to sell some books back to the store. After hearing what the buyback value was, a guy behind me said hed pay $20 more for my books (he was taking the same course the next semester sand the stores mark up would by 100%). The bookstore owner warned me if I sold to this other dude, Id be banned for life. I told him money makes the world go round and took my extra twenty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145300.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. My uncle got us banned from a mom and pops diner in the 90s. The unintended but totally foreseeable consequence of doing their eat a 72oz steak in under an hour six goddamn times in two weeks. I know for a fact he does not regret it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145301.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Got banned from a John Lewis (kinda upscale retail gaff in the uk) for browsing items. This was pre covid too. The jobsworth of a guard came up and told me to leave since I was and I quote just picking stuff up and putting them back again like no s**t sherlock thats how browsing in a physical store works. So now Im banned from John Lewis</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145302.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. The prison I used to work at.

I had tried numerous times to receive therapy to treat PTSD I gained while working the job and thanks to the HR taking their vacation was not able to get it and the administrative assistant warden told me, quite literally, officers dont need therapy and if they do then they arent cut out to be officers and refused to help me find help.

When they learned (somehow) that I had sought therapy on my own, they attempted to place me on indefinite administrative leave citing officer has conducted themselves in a manner unfitting their position

So yeah. I sued them and quit and they banned me for life... from their prison.

Okay.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145303.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

I called my bank to tell them to not let them withdraw from my account since they had my checking account information. My bank said they have multiple situations happen with planet fitness about their Unusual financial practices. 2 months later I got a letter from planet fitness saying I’m banned from ever signing up with them again. Planet fitness is a POS corporation.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145304.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. There was a roller rink in town that posted on social media that they were having a deal on handmade pizzas and a pitcher of soda to try and drum up business.

The picture clearly showed a digiorno pizza and I commented saying that it was. My comment was deleted, and then I went back to say, “you deleted my comment saying that this is a digiorno pizza.”

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Got fired and banned from Lowe’s for not working hard enough. Honestly, if I was gonna lose my job for something, it was climbing the shelves, making myself a little cubicle in the shelves I could sleep in…and stealing hundreds worth of cold brew coffee.

In my defense, however, I had 11-hour overnight shifts. Never again.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145313.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Not me, but an ex. He walked into a Best Buy to look at Fitbits. He picked one up, concealed it and walked into the restroom to steal it. What he didnt know was that a Best Buy employee was in the restroom and heard him opening the package. He walked out of the stall, Fitbit on his wrist and came fact to face with the employee. They charged him and he spent a night in jail.

<span style="font-size:4em">2. In 2019, a doghouse in Costa Rica was struck by a meteorite. Shockingly, its actually incredibly rare for an object to actually be hit by a meteorite, and as a result, the doghouse became one of the most valuable pieces at a space-themed auction. The doghouse ended up selling for $44,000, while a piece of the meteorite itself went for $21,000. And in case you were wondering, the house belonged to a pup named Roky, who was in the house when the meteor struck, but was luckily unharmed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143247.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

More than 263 pieces of debris have fallen at Point Nemo since 1971.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143250.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Ever wondered why some countries drive on the left side of the road? It dates all the way back to the Roman Empire.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. In the 1990s, Marlon Brando, famous for his role in The Godfather, used to spend his days in AOL chatrooms, where he would get into political arguments with strangers. Brandos account was frequently suspended after telling people to fuck off when they didnt agree with him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143252.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Marcel Petiot was a French doctor who was suspected of killing over 60 people. Petiot served in World War I, but was discharged after he injured his own foot with a grenade. After the war, Petiot turned to medicine, and completed an accelerated medical program designed for war veterans. He moved to Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, a commune in Northern France. Petiot quickly gained a reputation of dubious practices after performing illegal abortions and supplying patients with narcotics, which he was also suspected to be abusing himself. Despite this, Petiot became mayor of Yonne, but was soon accused of theft.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143253.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. After this accusation, Petiot fled to Paris, where he opened a new medical practice. He used fake credentials to attract patients and in 1936, was appointed médecin détat-civil, which meant he was able to write death certificates. During World War II, he provided people fake disability certificates so they could avoid having to serve. Petiot also created a fake escape route under the name Dr. Eugène. He told people he could get them out of France, and lured Jewish people and Resistance fighters to a secret passageway. Petiot told them they needed a certain vaccine before escaping, and then injected them with cyanide and burned their bodies in the basement of his house after stealing their belongings.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143254.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. French authorities discovered this plot in 1943 after several of Petiots accomplices ratted him out. Much to the authorities dismay, they couldnt find Petiot anywhere. Turns out, he had adopted a new identity, and was now acting as Henri Valeri. As Valeri, he joined the French Forces Of The Interior and quickly moved up the ranks to become captain. One of his main duties? Find Marcel Petiot. He was recognized at a train station and captured several months later. Petiot went on trial in 1946, where he admitted to killing 63 enemies. The media began calling him Dr. Satan. He was executed by guillotine two months after the trial.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143255.gif" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Vincent Van Gogh didnt begin his painting career until his late twenties, and enrolled in art school in 1880 at age 27. Despite his late start, he created over 2,100 works of art.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143257.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Those 2,100 works of art included over 850 oil paintings and over 1,300 watercolors and sketches. Most of his paintings are from the last two years of his life. Van Gogh died by suicide in 1890.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143258.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Finches, sparrows, and other species of birds who live in cities will often line their nests with cigarette butts from the streets. Why? The nicotine smells deter predators and parasites. While this tactic keeps out pests, researchers are investigating the potential consequences of this practice. Many compounds in cigarette butts are known carcinogens, while others are pesticides.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143259.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. In the 1930s, Louis Rothschild, the Jewish heir to the Austrian branch of the Rothschild banking dynasty, was worth about 2 billion shillings, or $10 billion in todays money. During World War II, Rothschild refused to leave Austria, which prompted the Nazis to capture him, believing they could leverage the businessmans life to gain access to his billions. After being held for 14 months, the Rothschild family gave the Nazis $21 million, which equals about $400 million in todays money in exchange for the safe return of Rothschild. It was the largest ransom for a single individual in history.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143260.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. George Carlin, the comedian who was also the narrator for the first several seasons of Thomas The Tank Engine, was nervous about performing his lines without an audience. Someone suggested a child be brought to the booth where he was recording, so that Carlin could perform to the child. While this request was denied, a producer suggested bringing along a teddy bear. For the next four seasons, Carlin spoke all of his lines to the stuffed animal.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143262.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. When developing the game cartridges for the Nintendo Switch, the game company decided to coat them in a foul-tasting film to dissuade babies and animals from putting them in their mouths. They used Denatonium Benzoate, which is known as the most bitter chemical compound. The coating is non-toxic, and designed to be so gross that anyone who puts it in their mouth will want to immediately spit it back out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143263.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Palm trees actually arent trees — theyre just large plants, like bamboo.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143264.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. While were all now familiar with the long process of Supreme Court justice hearings, it used to be a much simpler affair. In fact, before 1916, Supreme Court justice nominees were simply voted on by the Senate. The hearing process began when President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis, a successful lawyer who served as one of Wilsons aides, to the court. Brandeis was Jewish, and several members of the Senate were opposed to the nomination of a Jewish man. It took four months of hearings before Brandeis nomination was confirmed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143265.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. At least nine fatal military flights were caused by the pilot having to pee during the flight. Military pilots used to have to unzip their flight suits and pee into a bag called a piddle pad. This was especially difficult for women, who often would refrain from drinking water before a flight, even though dehydration can dramatically affect vision and reaction time. As a result, the US Air Force is developing a new technology that involves a pad for women, and a cup for men attached to a tube through a special pair of underwear, which will pull their pee through the tube to a collection bag.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143266.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. There was once a time when Burger King wasnt quite fast food. From 1992 to 1994, the chain used to offer table service, with waiters delivering patrons their food to promote their new BK Dinner Baskets. They even brought popcorn to every table as an appetizer. The initiative only lasted for two years, and was quietly discontinued.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143267.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. After the Titanic sunk in 1912, over 118,000 people claimed that they were supposed to be on the ship, but missed the inaugural voyage for various reasons. “Up to the present time the count shows that just 118,337 people escaped death because they missed the Titanic or changed their minds a moment before sailing time,” an Ohio newspaper wrote weeks after the tragedy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143268.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. After leaving office, President Ulysses S. Grant was facing financial failure after a series of bad investments and lavish living. His son had started his own investment firm with a friend named Ferdinand Ward. Grant agreed to let Ward handle his money. What Grant and his son didnt know was that Ward was running a large Ponzi scheme, and was pocketing Grants money for years. In poor health and close to bankruptcy, Grant decided he would sell his memoirs. He began writing, but was diagnosed with cancer while working on the project.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143269.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Grant was desperate to finish writing before his death so that his family wouldnt face poverty. He signed a contract stating he would receive 10% of the profits, a deal that was standard for the time. Mark Twain, who was one of Grants close friends, heard about the deal and thought it was appalling that a former president on the verge of death wasnt given a larger deal. Twain stepped in and offered Grant a new contract, complete with a large advance payment, living expenses, and 70% of the books profits. Grant reluctantly accepted, and finished the book in July 1885. He died a week later, but his wife Julia earned nearly $11 million (in todays money) thanks to Twains deal. Talk about a good friend!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143270.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. In November 2008, a factory worker named Ronald Ball allegedly found a dead mouse in his can of Mountain Dew. He said that he had given Pepsi, who distributes Mountain Dew, the mouse and later sued the company for $50,000. The case made headlines again in 2012 when Pepsi revealed that they had called a veterinary pathologist to testify in the case. The pathologist said that the drink was so acidic that a mouse would turn into a jelly-like substance within 30 days of being trapped in the can. The mouse Ball had given them was too young to have been trapped in the can given the timeline. By August 2012, the case had been settled out of court.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143271.gif" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. William Shakespeare wrote about a tenth of the worlds most quoted lines.

<span style="font-size:4em">25. The Dahomey Amazons was a military comprised of women who were trained to protect the kingdom of Dahomey, a West African empire that existed from 1625 to 1894. The Amazons were known for their fearlessness, and were seen as equals to men. They were officially incorporated as official members of the army in the mid-1800s, and went on to fight against French colonizers.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143273.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. The women in this army were known for being ruthless, stopping at nothing to protect their kingdom. An Italian priest recounted a training exercise during which he watched the Amazons scale 120 meter-high thorn bushes. He said that not a single one complained during the exercise. The Amazons went on to inspire the Dora Milaje, the all-women army in the Black Panther franchise.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143274.gif" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. My eyes are insanely sensitive to light. Sunlight & fluorescent. LED, CFL, & incandescent above maybe 40 watts.

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Before I got my current job a month ago, I only had about 6 other interviews over the course of 5 months. At most of them, the recruiter would always be so confused about why Ive lived in so many places and it was so annoying and weird. I was a military kid, my parents moved when I was in college and now I live in a completely different state from them because thats where my fiance ended up. I dont really understand why thats confusing.

## <a href="#linky18" id="linky17">Nic Cage Gets Candid Answering the Internet's Burning Questions</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Q - Who is your favorite character in all of literature and film? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/043143/87144050/east-of-eden.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

A - That is so hard to answer. I will say that James Dean’s performance as Cal in East of Eden is largely the reason I became a film actor. His role in that is one of my favorite characters in cinema. But then we can go all the way to Rasputin or we can go to Dmitri Karamazov. Dmitri Karamazov is one my favorite characters in literature. I love him so much because he’s so happy and he has no money. He’s just living it up. He spent all his money trying to get the girl. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/043715/87144052/download.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">


I did the same thing once. I was very Dmitri Karamazov in high school. The most beautiful girl in high school who was a grade older than me invited me to the prom but I had no money. My grandmother gave each of us a little bond. My older brother bought a car. My second oldest brother bought some stereo equipment. And I splashed out on a chauffeur-driven limousine, a tuxedo and a four course meal at Le Dome on Sunset blvd. The car was $2000, the stereo was $2000, and my prom night was $2000 and man, that was money well spent. THAT’s Dmitri Karamazov.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/043835/87144053/34017122-8807887-image-m-131_1601929849363.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Q: I have a 2 regarding the movie Willys Wonderland. Did you or the director decide that you would not say a single word the whole movie, and 2, every time you went to recharge (grab a can from 6 pack) was it secretly filled with alcohol or anything like that? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044016/87144055/image.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

A: The dialogue for my character in Willy’s Wonderland was very sparse, so I decided with Kevin, the director, to go full Harpo Marx and take all the dialogue out because I thought that would be a fun acting challenge to see how much I could communicate without words and only with movement and facial expressions. I’m very happy with the results of Willy’s Wonderland. It was a good experiment. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044156/87144056/the_unbearable_weight_of_massive_talent_229253.0.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

The can question is an interesting one, and I hesitate to answer it for you because your relationship with the movie is far more important than my relationship with the movie and so you as the audience member can imagine and surmise whatever you want to be in that can. That is a far better answer and reason for the can than anything I could tell you. I want YOUR opinion as to what was in the can, because that was the right opinion.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044416/87144058/merlin_190797741_3bd42c19-5686-46c9-b90d-99f6c84d2c13-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Q: You and Pedro seemed like you had so much fun making this movie; what is one story you don’t mind sharing that you haven’t yet about your experience with filming and working with Pedro? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044521/87144059/EB20040425REVIEWS08404250302AR.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: First and foremost, Pedro Pascal is a genuinely nice man. You couldn’t ask for a nicer more pleasant person to work with. Second, he has a very unique sense of humor. It’s the kind of sense of humor where I don’t know if he’s really making a joke or he isn’t making a joke. Such as comment about the appearance of a cabbage in a cabbage field. And it made me wonder if he was a method actor and was in character and adding a kind of confused dimension to the Javi role, or if he genuinely thought the cabbage was amusing. I am still confounded by this. I mean who makes a joke about cabbage, except him? It’s just not funny!

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Q: What has been your most challenging role to get into character each day to film? What is your favorite character that youve ever portrayed? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044732/87144065/1498576162376-cage12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: I would say that Nick Cage in Massive Talent was the most challenging role I had to get into character for because I had the added component of trying to protect a person named Nick Cage and also facilitating the director’s absurdist vision of so-called Nick Cage and it was a highwire act every day. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044931/87144066/343423131441.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

Again, Pig is my favorite performance of mine, and I think that movie, along with Scorsese’s Bringing Out The Dead are arguably my two best movies as a whole</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045052/87144067/MV5BMTMzNzA0MTUzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEyNzkwNQ@@._V1_.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Q: I know you have a love of the silent era, especially the German expressionist stuff. What’s your favorite silent film? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045208/87144068/52744-posts.facebook_lg.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: Boy that’s a hard list to conjure up because there are so many memorable ones but I would say that Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera comes to mind but Nosferatu, Schreck, his performance, and even Barrymore in Jekyll and Hyde. I think that Barrymore did more to inspire Schreck’s performance than the other way around. Oh, and anything Chaplin did was magic: City Lights, Modern Times. It depends on the season!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045410/87144069/05a.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Q: Pig was an absolutely incredible film, what drew you to that project, and why do you think that it struck a cord with so many people? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045541/87144092/1308201.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

A: Thank you. I was interested in returning to a more quiet, naturalistic style of film performance, having done a series of more operatic performance styles. The movie feels rather like a folk song to me or a poem, and the character of Rob was contending with tremendous grief and self imposed isolation and I think we as a group of people experiencing a pandemic in 2020-21 we’re probably also having similar feelings of loss and isolation and it communicated to a nerve we were all experiencing. Its one of my favorite movies, and its probably my best work.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045655/87144093/wild-at-heart-slide-1.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Q: Have you seen Leaving Las Vegas recently? I think that is my all time favorite Nicolas Cage performance. How do you feel thinking back on Leaving Las Vegas and your performance in it? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045942/87144094/types-of-pasta-1581024990.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: Thank you. I think Leaving Las Vegas, Pig and Bringing Out The Dead are my three favorite performances of my own body of work. I have not seen Leaving Las Vegas recently, however that movie and Elizabeth Shue’s work in that movie are what I aspire to continue towards, and did continue towards with Pig, which is why I am always going to be up for small budget, independent, dramas.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/050203/87144095/1500386626-credit-melinda-sue-gordon.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Q: Ethan Hawke said that youre the first actor since Marlon Brando to do something new with the art of acting. Any thoughts on that? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/050341/87144096/nationaltreasure_niccage1.gif" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: It’s very kind of Ethan to say so, as you may well know, I’ve worked with Ethan in Lord of War and have always been spellbound by his talent. I think many of the choices I’ve made have been inspired by film stars from the silent era as well as cultural expression of performance like Kabuki and some of the Golden Age actors like Cagney so I don’t know how to say I’ve done something new because those elements are always on my mind
