## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">The Most Unprofessional Things Doctors Have Ever Said</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I went to the doctors to get my breasts checked (he basically just held and caressed them in a manner he wouldnt have had a chance to feel anything potentially dangerous) and due to them causing me a lot of physical pain I asked him about my options regarding breast reduction surgery. He got visibly angry and told me to never even think about it, and called them beautiful and tender. He was well in his 50s and I was 18-19. I paid like 50 dollars for master roshi to ignore my health issues and make me find another doctor who actually wanted to help people. -u/bratsbane</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173795.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Had a bad head injury when I was a kid (12 or 13) and saw a bunch doctors trying to figure out what was wrong. Got a little snippy with one of them over something I don’t even remember. Pulled up the medical record years later and she referred to me as a “child of the devil” in her report. Had to make some phone calls to get that “diagnosis” removed from my record. -u/DuckSkrol</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173796.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Said that if I wasnt his patient hed take me home. Yeah...hes no longer my doctor. -u/jessabear0201</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173797.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Had a doctor in the 80s tell my mom my severe life-threatening disease, was not real because theres no real evidence that there is a genetic basis for disease. Despite my genetic disease being well studied.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Another doc at the same surgery slapped me hard in the knee and told me I was faking it for a day off school. 6 months later Id need a full knee reconstruction. And mom kept taking me there... -u/cacti-myco</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173800.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Unprofessional, but funny. I had taken my 92-year-old mother to a recheck appointment to her PCP. An apparently new medical assistant was dutifully getting her history by reading off a checklist. When she asked when Moms last period was, I looked at Mom a little nervously. She was VERY old school, very dignified and would typically never acknowledge to her sons that she had female parts.

<span style="font-size:4em">
I saw a rare twinkle in Moms eyes as she calmly replied, well, I cant give you an exact number of months, but Im pretty sure it was sometime in the late 1960s. The assistant had the good grace to laugh with us, apologize, then read the next question.

Do you think you might be pregnant? -u/jakobedlam</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173804.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Youre not depressed, you dont look sad. You must just be tired! Here, take these sleeping pills, but dont take them all at once! -u/Nicxll</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173805.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. When I was in junior high, I went out for the basketball team. I had to take a physical and it had to be done by the schools doctor and not my own. I went in to do the physical and had to get naked. I did so and the doctor looked me over. He saw that I have an inverted breast bone and said Wow. That is freakish. You cant be on the team with that. I know that my breast bone makes it look like I have a hole in my chest, but I had never been self-conscious about it until that moment.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Because this examination was taking place in the boys locker room in front of other kids wanting to go out for the team too, everyone started laughing at me and calling me names. I grabbed my sh*t and left. My mother took me to our regular doctor who reassured me that there was nothing wrong with me and that there are plenty of people who have breast bones just like mine. It didnt help but I appreciated that she explained it to me. I stopped taking off my shirt in front of others. I was harassed and bullied by my entire classic for years to come because a doctor made a comment that he shouldnt have made. -u/jimmypfromthe5thgala</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173808.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I had a doctor comment on how I’ve lost weight (fine, I get that), but when I told him I started going to a gym he told me not to try to build muscle because it will just turn to fat someday anyway. -u/Deleted</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173809.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Was given a condescending lecture on how I shouldnt have come in if I just had a cold by both a doctor at a walk-in center, and my GP in a follow-up appt the week following.

<span style="font-size:4em">
I ended up getting rushed into resuscitation a few weeks later with a punctured lung that caused a one-way valve in my lung where air could escape into my chest cavity but not get back out. Because it was brushed off/not properly investigated it caused a life-threatening condition called Tension Pneumothorax where the pressure that had built up over time on one side of my chest caused my lung to collapse completely and started crushing my heart and other lung, and compressing/bending the arteries, veins, and esophagus in my neck.

When they put a chest drain into me my chest cavity literally sounded like it was deflating like a car tire puncture. -u/SneakyBlades</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173813.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I was looking for a surgeon for my gallstone operation and he asked what meds I was on. I mentioned my antidepressants and he started saying I didnt need to take them I just needed to pray. I was pissed and replied, I guess Ill just pray my gallstones away too, then. Needless to say, I went with a different surgeon. -u/maggyta10</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173817.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. When I was 21, I dislocated my shoulder and it continued to hurt for weeks. Went to a specialist, and he suggested the pain was all in my head! After an MRI he realized I had a SLAP tear in my shoulder, so I said, looks like its not all in my head, and he looked at me with such contempt, I never went back to that a**hole. -u/feral_philosopher</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173814.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Pediatrician looked at our toddler, standing with a swayback (lordosis) posture, then without considering anything else turned to my wife and said, she stands like that because you baby her too much. That was only our first clue that the doctor was a f*cking moron. -u/rhesusfecespieces</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173816.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

In the nineties, I took on an old server, souped it up, and put Linux on it to run our networks. This was pretty radical at the time because everyone else was using something proprietary (Like Netware) and I was able to deliver services for free (email and samba) they were paying out the nose for.

I told them that I was but it was a big pay cut and I understood if they left and would be happy to write them a letter of recommendation.


They all stayed. I was an under an NDA that precluded me from telling them that there were about 5 of us out of the 50 that all kept our previous pay rate. They obviously assumed that I was taking a pay cut with them by staying. Im pretty sure that NDA wouldnt hold up in court, but I didnt know that at the time.

## <a href="#linky6" id="linky5">30 Things Professionals Wish Their Customers Knew</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Nuclear engineer here, and if you think radiation is the devil incarnate then buckle in for a quick second as I tell you that:1) No one from Fukushima died from radiation exposure. You saw pictures of the horrific devastation from the earthquake and tsunami. Flooding a nuclear plant doesnt topple buildings.2) Nuclear is one of the safest, renewable, and cleanest energy sources that exist. Second cleanest only to water (and air if you count that).3) Unless we start growing energy and picking it off the vine, oil and coal will run out in the very foreseeable future and nuclear is the way to go.4) You get more radiation from eating a banana than anyone ever did from 3 Mile Island. The most radiation I get everyday is from my morning fruit and I play with radioactive sources and crystals all day.5) Nuclear is actually really cool and by making it to the bottom of the list youre pretty cool too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168271.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. We are not in the habit of intentionally hurting children.It makes me absolutely insane when a new parent asks, about everything, if its safe for the baby.Guys. Im assuming you came to the hospital because you decided it was the safest place to deliver a baby. Why not trust us once you get here?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168293.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. As someone in the movie/tv business, most people dont realize that doctoring and altering footage is really really really easy for someone with the right software. I see my old relatives falling for obviously fake footage all the time because they trust all video to be real.This problem is only going to get worse as the software gets better.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168272.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. A significant portion of active duty military personnel (in the U.S., at least) spend a majority of their time sitting at a desk doing basic administration work.Im technically trained in my job speciality, but since Im not exactly in a combat zone when not deployed, I spend most days at a computer answering e-mails and s**t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168285.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Unless its an actual emergency youll have to wait in the ER. It sucks, we know, but a suspected heart attack will be treated before a busted knee.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168273.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Organically grown produce is still grown using pesticides. I stopped arguing with people when I realized the fact that I worked for the EPA and it was literally my job didnt dissuade them from arguing with me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168274.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Wind farms require environmental impact studies that take birds in account. Yes, they do have an impact, but so does the playground in front of your house.And trust me, if we dont put wind farms up and keep burning coal, its gonna be worse, even for the birds.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168270.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. When youre in a hospital, not every man is a doctor and not every woman is a nurse.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168275.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Doctors/healthcare workers use dark humour as a form of resilience not to be callous or flippant.A lot of traumatic events occur in a hospital on a daily basis. Sometimes a dark joke is the difference between breaking down emotionally or being able to compartmentalise and treat you with all our wits about us.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168276.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Graphic Designer here (but this applies to a lot of creative professions). Doing a job faster actually means I need to be paid *more*, not less.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168277.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I work as deskside IT support for an office.Anyone could do my job if they knew how to google and read tech forums. Besides, 75% of my job is customer service, 20% knowledge, and 5% politics.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168278.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. As your childs teacher, I see them for 53 minutes a day for 180 days of the year. I cannot undo all of the poor habits youve taught/enabled/encourage and make your kid successful. I see people post on the book of faces about their childs [lousy] teacher because they wont do x or y when those things are the responsibility of the parent. Also, my contract says I work until 3. I will not call, text, or meet with you after hours because I need to have my own life separate from my work life which is really hard for parents to understand for some reason.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168279.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. As a plumber replying to my customer who just hovered over me during the whole repair:Yes, you could have done this yourself.Yes, you would have saved 100s of dollars.No, I cant come down on the price because of how simple it looked to you. We are a business and I gave you the quote before I started.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168269.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. The more you know how the Internet really works, the more youre amazed that it still works at all.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168280.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Writing code is not really that exciting to watch. It is very unlikely that you will have a lot of cool graphics or special effects on the screen.Its going to be some slightly color-coded words, and very little else.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168281.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. You cannot check-in to a hotel without giving us a deposit or a working credit card to protect us from possible damages.There arent gonna be any damages.OH OK, I GUESS WE DONT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT THEN</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168282.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. One teacher, plus 32 kids doesnt yield optimum results.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168283.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. The pastures you drive by dont just exist on their own. Grass is an actively managed crop.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168284.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. If I cared what teenagers thought of me, I wouldn’t be a high school teacher. No, I don’t go home and drink away their lame insults. They don’t bother me, they’re just hormonal kids, and I love my job.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168286.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Different artists excel at doing different styles. I work primarily in watercolor, my website and my portfolio are almost entirely watercolor pieces, and yet I regularly field requests from clients asking if I can do oil painting, mural painting, or God Forbid, tattoo them. Just yesterday I had someone ask if Id give them a tattoo, which I have never done before, have not trained in...I try to refer people to other artists I know who work in the styles and mediums theyre looking for.But you make lots of cool things!YES. IN WATERCOLOR.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168287.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Solving IT problems usually is done with efficient google searches, reading support articles, and checking out forums. Very little of the information I use for fixing computers was obtained organically (trial-and-error, or training, etc). IT people just google. They consider us wizards but really we just know how to search well.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168288.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Might be a bit late but the reason you see railway workers standing around and on their phone when your train goes past is because if they were working that same train would HIT THEM.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168289.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. If youre hiring a musician to an event you pay us for playing ofc, AND for the time it takes to rehearse and arrange the songs or pieces you want us to play.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168290.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Electricity is dangerous. Yeah getting shocked by an outlet is nothing more then a quick scare when youre dry. But when youre wet its almost certain death (a painful one at that). And when you get into some larger stuff it will literally vaporize you. If youre untrained, you should leave electrical work to the professionals.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168291.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. 95% of the stuff you want to tell your lawyer before arraignment is irrelevant. I know youre scared because s**t is getting real and youre being charged with a crime, and I know you see everything going on as one big interconnected tangle that has to be straightened out once and for all, but all that happens at arraignment of any consequence is the probable cause determination and conditions of release. Im not ignoring you, I know I only have about ten minutes I can spend with you before we go in front of the judge, but ten minutes is about twice what Id need if we stayed on topic. All the rest of that stuff Id be happy to take the time to carefully comb through with you in my office between now and your first pretrial.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168292.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
