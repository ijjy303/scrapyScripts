###### 23. Theres the numerous musicians from the 1950s-1980s who knowingly raped young teenage girls. This isnt even a case of changing standards. Even back then some of what these guys were doing was thought badly of. Elvis was criticized for marrying a 14-year-old girl. Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin) had a 14-year-old girl kidnapped and dated her for two years.-u/water_bottle1776<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87128029.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#7" id="6">25 Traumatizing Films That Really Messed Us Up</a><br>

###### 1. Lorenzos Oil is a hard film to watch because its about a child whos dying of an incurable genetic disorder, it sticks pretty closely to the medical facts of the case its based on, and it unfolds from the parents point of view. Harrowing stuff even though the story isnt totally bleak and it was nominated for awards. -u/doublestitch

###### 2. When the Wind Blows from 1986. For anyone who doesn’t know it, heres a short summary from wiki: “The film accounts a rural English couples attempt to survive a nearby nuclear attack and maintain a sense of normality in the subsequent fallout and nuclear winter.”

###### 7. Jacobs Ladder is weird for me because I consider it one of my favorite movies of all time, but Ive only seen it three times over the course of 25 years or so. Each rewatch has confirmed to me that a.) it is a cinematic masterpiece, and b.) it leaves me in such a deeply affected headspace that I know I cant watch it again in the immediate future. -u/your_actual_life<br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87127967.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Then it ends as a proper sci-fi horror with a dude strapped to an exam table on an alien craft being aggressively examined by some ugly-ass humanoid aliens while his screams are muffled by some kind of giant full-body alien condom.

###### 19. Pan’s Labyrinth. Not necessarily the fantasy part of it, but the main antagonist (Vidal) and the ending. Just horrific. I cry every time. Also, for context, the scene with the Pale Man even scared Stephen freaking King, the reigning king of literary horror. It’s a fantastic and beautiful film but it’s not for the faint of heart.
