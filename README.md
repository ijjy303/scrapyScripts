## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">30 Weird Statistics That Are Somehow True</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Women use an average of 20,000 words a day, compared to the mere 7,000 that men utter.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87189345.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Hold up your hands and clap them together.

Wait one second, then do it again.

If you could plot the distance between the first clap and the second clap, it would be more than 800 kilometers.

This is because the Earth is moving around the sun, the sun is moving around the center of the galaxy, the galaxy is moving through the Virgo Supercluster, and the Virgo Supercluster is barreling through the universe. When you add up all the velocities and compare the result to the cosmic microwave background (which is the closest thing we have to a universal frame of reference), it comes out to about 800 kilometers per second.

In the time it took you to read this, youve traveled farther than youll ever walk in your life.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87189324.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. 80% of Orange Tabby cats are male.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87189325.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Australia has more kangaroos than humans.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87189326.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Wearing a seatbelt correctly reduces chance of front seat passenger fatality due to front end collision by 45%. Seat belts save lives. For f***s sake people, wear them. Also airbags are more likely to cause injuries rather than prevent them when seat belts are not worn.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87189327.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The tallest giraffe ever measured (George) was 19 feet (5.8m) tall.

The longest crocodile ever measured (Lolong) was 20.25 feet (6.17m) long

So take the tallest giraffe youve ever seen, and then add a little, and youve got the biggest crocodile ever measured reliably with a tape measure down its back.

Herpetologists agree that sightings of crocodiles up to 23 feet are not unreasonable, but theyre very hard to capture when theyre that big. Therefore, no absolutely reliable numbers.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87189328.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Statistically speaking the average person is a 30 year old Chinese man.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87189329.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Sharks are older than trees. Sharks are at least 400 million years old, trees are sitting at 350 million years.

Edit: Also another fun fact, sharks are so successful when it comes to evolution and long term survival because of a trait called Adaptive Radiation, which is a huge increase of species diversity in a short period of time. Modern sharks stem from an adaptive radiation that happened during the Jurassic Period about 200 million years ago. One of the newest modern sharks is the hammerhead, coming in at around 50 million years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87189330.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">Former Employees Spill Surprising Industry Secrets</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Call center here. Just because you hear music when I put you on hold, doesnt mean I do.I can hear every profanity you utter.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185164.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I work on a farm. When they say you should wash your produce thoroughly at home, theyre not joking.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185167.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I was a deep sea diver for 10 years in the Gulf of Mexico. Huge oil spills happen and are covered up hundreds of times a year by every company. The entire industry is in on it. The bottom of the gulf is a disgusting garbage dump. Every boat dumps their trash into the gulf. No one obeys the laws and the coast guard doesnt enforce s**t. I had a bunch of requests for an AMA so Im doing one now if anyone has more questions.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185165.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. If you own your own business, never and I mean never do any work for anyone with the promise of more business later on, if they want you to do it free the first time. Just drop them as clients and move on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185166.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Large chain bookstores: so so so many perfectly good books get thrown out...Mass market paperbacks are cheap to manufacture and get shipped out in huge volumes. For some publishers (particularly ones that put out new mysteries or romances quarterly) when the bookstore wants it off the shelf to make room for something new, its just not worth the cost of taking them back and finding someone else to sell it. But they dont want anyone getting them for free. So as a bookstore employee I spent hours ripping the front and back covers off of books, then tearing the book at least in half so that no one could read it later. The covers get sent back to the publishers, and the books that could have been donated to a library or school get put in a locked recycling container out back. A manager had to come back and check my work to make sure the books were not left intact.I almost cried the first time I had to rip up a load of kids books (in a city with high child poverty rates and underfunded schools).</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185163.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. It is impossible to crawl through ventilation shafts. Professional duct worker here.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185168.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. We already have developed better, safer medicines than most of the crap currently on the market. However due to the following reasons, most of it will never reach the market. FDA Approval costs a fair amount of money and time, and for a new drug to be approved takes bloody years. The slightest mess up in testing and back to the beginning. Money. If a new drug discovery is not going to be as profitable as the stuff currently on the market, it will simply be patented and sat on.* Research funding: Not enough of it anymore to properly explore all the possibilities.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185169.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Nurse assistant here. If you have taken any illegal drugs, or prescription drugs to get high within the last 24 hours... F*****G TELL US. It could save your life. We wont judge you for it... But we would judge you for bullsh**ting us even if your life could be at risk.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185170.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Graphic designer here. For the last time, just because we have Photoshop and Illustrator doesnt mean the design process is on auto-pilot. So when we say we need an extra hour to work out your problem, we mean it. And yes, we need the vector file of your logo, or at least a PDF copy of it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185171.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. The groundbreaking scientific results published by the mainstream media bear little resemblance to the results published in the actual scientific article.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185172.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I work in the space industry and I am happy to report that there are no tricks here, everything must work with multiple redundant systems.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185173.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Car dealership. WE ARE SCAMMING YOU.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185174.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Video editor here for reality TV. Its fake for the most part. They usually do multiple takes of the reality scenes that are staged beforehand. The most recent egregious use of this is Duck Dynasty. They pass the show off as reality tv and they actually have table readings for that show before shoots. Not saying that reality TV isnt sometimes entertaining. Im just saying that you shouldnt be fooled into thinking that this is actually reality and the camera just happened to be there when these people were doing what they normally do.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185175.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. I worked for a political consulting firm and was completely floored when congressmen/women would come in for media training (learning to be normal on camera or in front of constituents). Nearly every politician who came in for training was clueless and literally had their views on the issues fed to them by my boss (the media strategist). Sounds obvious, but its really horrifying to witness.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185176.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. From my former job: The US military has a tradition where you spend your entire budget by Oct (the new fiscal year) or you risk losing that portion of your budget. Ive been in units that would go out and purchase $200,000 worth of useless s**t just to avoid having a budget surplus. Multiply by the number of units in the military (a s**t ton) and you have all your fraud, waste and abuse.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185177.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Im in radio. We dont get to pick what we play on air, the pd schedules it and we just talk in between songs. The closest we get is when we play a request, thats usually something we wanted to hear and no one actually requested it.The guys down at the talk station ironically can play whatever they want but think the last good song came out in 1975.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185178.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. When you climb into a helicopter and the rotors are turning, you cant reach your arm up high enough to lose a hand....but we dont want anyone trying to test it or prove us wrong.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185179.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. A lot of people know this, but, the police can lie to you. About damn near anything. If you are ever arrested, shut the f**k up. Request a lawyer. I can repeat this, but you dumb motherf**kers will still talk to the f**king cops. You are soooo much better off just not talking to them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185182.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Retail here. If you argue about the price of something and I dont have an easy way to check it I will probably give it to you for your price....but if you do this I will be silently hating you, at least until you leave the store and I forget you exist.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185183.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. School photographer here. Do not coach your children on how to smile. I can normally get them to smile naturally with a funny word or simply by smiling at them. I have seen MANY kids that have obviously coached smile because they are afraid mom will take away their Playstation. Remember that school photos are a marking of time, love your kid for who they are at that moment. And NEVER tell your kiddo to not show their teeth. Second graders are supposed to have lots of missing teeth-- its charming. Seventh graders have braces-- that photo will remind them of such a tumultuous time in their life. And lastly, there is always re-take day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185184.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Harley Davidson is in pretty bad shape, they store the lions share of their new motorcycles in some warehouses in Montana because they dont want to stop production just to keep shareholder happy. They are a ticking time bomb.Oh also for the last few years they force retailers to buy some new bikes every year even though they dont change. If the retailers dont buy them they lose their licensing to sell Harleys.So basically all their sales have been made up for the last five or so years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185185.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. people working in a liquor store almost always are drinking on the job.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185186.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. In almost every labor job Ive worked, including being a valet, people smoke and drink on the job. The valet service I worked for never even asked to see my drivers license.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185188.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. The Olive Oil Industry is controlled by the Mafia. In 2007 only 4% of italian olive oil leaving italy was actually pure olive oil. Fake olive oil has the similar profit margins as cocaine trafficking with none of the risk. About 70% of the olive oil that comes into the US is thought to be a fraud.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185189.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Teacher here.Your childs success depends mainly on three things: the childs will, the parents support, and the teachers skill. If your child doesnt want to learn, he wont learn. If you dont f**king feed your child properly, he wont be able to learn. If your child gets his way at home, he will be a terror in class and wont succeed.I am only a part of your childs education. I cant do anything if he refuses to learn or if you refuse to support him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185190.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. I work in lingerie and ladies, theres a 70% chance youre wearing the wrong bra size if you havent been measured in the last 3-6 months. With any weight gain or loss, your breasts are the first thing to fluctuate in size. Also, dont argue after a bra fitting by saying I am NOT that size! Yes, you are. I do this for a living. Please trust that I know how to do my job.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185191.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. If more citizens knew how often U.S. Military individuals said things along the lines of, F**k civilians, they can suck my d**k. People might lose some of their unrelenting support for the troops.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185192.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Im a celebrity event photographer in Hollywood. Most of the smaller award shows winners like the MTV VMAs, Teen Choice Awards, etc...already know they are going to win. This motivates the talent to come to the event. During the show they are backstage talking with friends and take a seat during a commercial break just before their award is announced. The few exceptions are the Oscars and Golden Globes where the audience is mostly celebrities.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185193.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky10" id="linky9">8 Things Your Body Might Be Hiding From You</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Whenever a drop in temperature on the palate occurs, the brain jumps into action to prevent freezing to death. In other words, the brain will increase blood pressure in an effort to tell the person to slow down a notch. This condition is called an ice cream headache. And it’s something we should all watch out for during summer days.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188088.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. This might sound like a cliché, but stress can literally change the shape of your heart. Takotsubo syndrome is a condition that causes the left ventricle to change shape and fail to pump blood properly. During short-term stress, 2 molecules known to be released during stress and depression can affect the activity of heart muscle cells, leading to a temporary failure. Luckily, managing stress and practicing breathing and meditation techniques cure this condition without the need for medication.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188089.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The human microbiome, also known as the gut environment, is an ecosystem made of various bacteria that have co-evolved with humans to benefit both the host and the bacteria. This bacterium is known to influence human psychology since it contains a profound number of chemicals that are used by our neurons to communicate and regulate mood, like dopamine and serotonin. Speaking of which, 95% of the body’s supply of serotonin is produced in the gut.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188091.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. The white matter is the tissue that connects neurons together, making communication possible between the various gray matter regions and between the gray matter and the rest of the body. As we age, our white matter degrades, resulting in symptoms like memory loss and difficulty solving problems.

But research has shown that dancing increases white matter in the brain, which increases cognitive function and keeps the brain in shape. And of course, it’s hard to be unhappy when you’re dancing. So it’s a win-win situation.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188090.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. As we grow older, our bodies shrink, but our noses and ears keep getting bigger. This happens because our skin starts to lose its elasticity and can’t retain the support that it once could. The nose and ears are no exceptions. These pronominal organs change in size as we age, but not because we’re growing — it’s because of gravity.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188094.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. We all have that friend who tells the same story each time with different details. The reason why they do that is that their memory is playing tricks on them. We often think of our brain as a machine that stores and arranges our memories for us, like a camera or a tape recorder.

While in reality, many studies have concluded that memories, even our most cherished ones, are malleable and are fallible. False memories can affect anyone, regardless of whether the memory is trivial or life-changing.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188093.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. The brain now is smaller than it used to be 3,000 years ago. Before assuming that this is bad news, remember that there is a correlation between the body and brain size. So, as the body grew smaller, so did the brain.

Yuval Noah Harari explained this phenomenon in a great way: “You give some, you take some.” Because of our developed cognitive and planning abilities, human beings no longer need larger bodies.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188092.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Exposing the skin to black light, also known as Wood’s light, can be used to detect bacterial and fungal skin infections as well as irregularities in skin pigmentation. Under a Wood’s lamp, healthy skin glows brightly without shining. It may display white spots when the skin is thick, yellow spots where the skin is greasy, and purple patches where the skin is dry.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188087.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
