<span style="font-size:4em">1. Switzerland has implemented a scheme ‘Time Bank’; which is an old-age assistance program, under which, people can volunteer to look after the elderly who require assistance, and then, the number of hours they spend with or caring for seniors gets deposited in their individual social security account. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87203517.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Eventually, when the volunteer reaches that old age when he or she requires support, this ‘Time Bank’ can help them by providing time-based services which include consultations, babysitting, hairdressing, gardening, tutoring, or any other time-consuming job in addition to being looked after by a volunteer as well. About 34 countries are trying to apply this scheme.

Also, stomping your foot like they do as well as turning your back on them when annoyed is understood too. If they have chewed something they shouldnt have you can stomp one foot and turn around with your arms folded. Have a look over your shoulder to make sure they see you. They should come to check on you and if they dont stomp and make sure they see your back is turned. Eventually they get it and come over to make sure your ok. Then let the nose waggling commence.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87203540.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Jacque Villeneuve, Michael Schumacher and Heinz Harald Frentzen set the exact same time in qualifying in the 1997 European Grand Prix. To the THOUSANDTH of a second.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The longest professional tennis match of all time: John Isner vs Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon 2010. It lasted 11 hours 5 minutes, spanning 3 days of play, with a final score of 6-4, 3-6, 6-7, 7-6, 70-68

<span style="font-size:4em">
It was already nearly twice as long as the previous record holder. The reason it will likely never be broken is that every professional tournament except for one (Roland-Garros) now has tiebreaker rules that limit the number of games that can be played in final sets. Although it’s hypothetically possible at RG, clay court tennis is not at all conducive to the serve-and-volley style of play that led to the insanely long 5th set of Isner-Mahut.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The current record for the Cannonball Run, a drive from NY to LA, is about 25.5 hours. It was set in May of 2020, and the drivers were able to make use of the lack of traffic due to the pandemic to break the record. Barring another similar world-changing event, traffic conditions will probably never be what they were when that record was set.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. When I was a kid, we had a Guinness book of records lying around that we liked to browse in while bored. There was this one guy in it who held a record for most bikes eaten. No, you did read that right. He ground up a bike and slowly consumed it over I dont know how long a time.

The record was accompanied by a note that no further records of bike eating would be accepted, as it was deemed too dangerous.

<span style="font-size:4em">
The current active pitcher with the most complete games in his career is Adam Wainwright, who has pitched for 17 years and has 27 complete games total. Pitchers just don’t pitch the whole game anymore, and Young’s record will never come close to being touched.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Luigi Fagioli won the 1951 French Grand Prix at the age of 53 years, 22 days - making him the oldest F1 winner in history. Given that F1 drivers rarely continue driving past 40 anymore, this record looks pretty safe.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. John Isner hit 113 aces in his 70-68 match at Wimbledon played over 3 days.

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Everyone is saying 30+ year old movies but a lot of movies that came out even 10 years ago wouldn’t be okay today.

Then there’s a girl who likes to have sex and that’s the joke. And Fat Amy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203347.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Sticks out like a sore thumb, even if you’re not normally the sort of person who pays attention to cinematography. You maybe see that sort of thing every once in a while today, but usually as a deliberate choice, not the default. Modern films usually use cuts, sometimes with diegetic sound from the upcoming scene playing early to let you know it’s coming, or find a way to incorporate it into the movement on-screen.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203350.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Fun fact: the giant tortoise was so delicious, it caused not only itself to be hunted to extinction, but also the dodo.Giant tortoise meat was supposedly better tasting than chicken. Its fat tasted better spread on bread than butter. Also, it was the perfect food for sailors at the time, as their bladders stored 1 litre of purified water, and they could survive without food in hibernation for almost a whole year in the hull of a ship. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87203164.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Not to mention, because they evolved without humans, they were easy to hunt. You could tie one to your back, and roll another to the ship and they would just let you. It was so delicious, they went unrecorded for a long time because expeditions to bring living samples of wildlife to Europe kept eating them on the way.Conversely, the dodo, while as easily captured by sailors, tasted awful. It was completely unpalatable.

HOWEVER, one day, someone discovered if you cooked dodo meat in the more delicious tortoise fat, it tasted just like chicken. So now, sailors were hunting a few tortoises at a time for their fat and water, storing them, and then hunting dodos on the daily.Overhunting, plus the introduction of rats to the environment (because sailors) which would eat eggs, led go the population to decline at a rate they could not breed to keep up, leading to both animals going extinct.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87203167.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
