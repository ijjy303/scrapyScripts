<span style="font-size:4em">2. Joe DiMaggios consecutive hit streak. Ichiros 262 hits in a season.

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The Lion King as the highest VHS sales of all time.

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Jacque Villeneuve, Michael Schumacher and Heinz Harald Frentzen set the exact same time in qualifying in the 1997 European Grand Prix. To the THOUSANDTH of a second.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The longest professional tennis match of all time: John Isner vs Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon 2010. It lasted 11 hours 5 minutes, spanning 3 days of play, with a final score of 6-4, 3-6, 6-7, 7-6, 70-68

<span style="font-size:4em">
It was already nearly twice as long as the previous record holder. The reason it will likely never be broken is that every professional tournament except for one (Roland-Garros) now has tiebreaker rules that limit the number of games that can be played in final sets. Although it’s hypothetically possible at RG, clay court tennis is not at all conducive to the serve-and-volley style of play that led to the insanely long 5th set of Isner-Mahut.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The current record for the Cannonball Run, a drive from NY to LA, is about 25.5 hours. It was set in May of 2020, and the drivers were able to make use of the lack of traffic due to the pandemic to break the record. Barring another similar world-changing event, traffic conditions will probably never be what they were when that record was set.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. When I was a kid, we had a Guinness book of records lying around that we liked to browse in while bored. There was this one guy in it who held a record for most bikes eaten. No, you did read that right. He ground up a bike and slowly consumed it over I dont know how long a time.
</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203366.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203367.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
The record was accompanied by a note that no further records of bike eating would be accepted, as it was deemed too dangerous.

-u/Picajosan</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203368.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
The current active pitcher with the most complete games in his career is Adam Wainwright, who has pitched for 17 years and has 27 complete games total. Pitchers just don’t pitch the whole game anymore, and Young’s record will never come close to being touched.

-u/VictorBlimpmuscle</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203375.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Luigi Fagioli won the 1951 French Grand Prix at the age of 53 years, 22 days - making him the oldest F1 winner in history. Given that F1 drivers rarely continue driving past 40 anymore, this record looks pretty safe.

-u/GrumpyCatStevens</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203372.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. John Isner hit 113 aces in his 70-68 match at Wimbledon played over 3 days. That record will never be broken because Wimbledon changed their rules so they can’t play that many games ever again! -u/deleted</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203365.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
It hasn’t been broken to this day due to how dangerous it is to go at those sort of speeds on the surface and plenty of people have passed away trying.

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Fun fact: the giant tortoise was so delicious, it caused not only itself to be hunted to extinction, but also the dodo.Giant tortoise meat was supposedly better tasting than chicken. Its fat tasted better spread on bread than butter. Also, it was the perfect food for sailors at the time, as their bladders stored 1 litre of purified water, and they could survive without food in hibernation for almost a whole year in the hull of a ship. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87203164.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Not to mention, because they evolved without humans, they were easy to hunt. You could tie one to your back, and roll another to the ship and they would just let you. It was so delicious, they went unrecorded for a long time because expeditions to bring living samples of wildlife to Europe kept eating them on the way.Conversely, the dodo, while as easily captured by sailors, tasted awful. It was completely unpalatable.

HOWEVER, one day, someone discovered if you cooked dodo meat in the more delicious tortoise fat, it tasted just like chicken. So now, sailors were hunting a few tortoises at a time for their fat and water, storing them, and then hunting dodos on the daily.Overhunting, plus the introduction of rats to the environment (because sailors) which would eat eggs, led go the population to decline at a rate they could not breed to keep up, leading to both animals going extinct.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87203167.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Revenge Of The Nerds. They break into the sorority house and steal underwear and install cameras. Lewis impersonates the boyfriend and has sex with Betty. They sell naked photos of her in pies to raise money. Not to mention all the stereotypical jokes about Lamar being gay and black. No way in hell that would go over today.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203330.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Roger Moore quit James Bond bc he felt it was too weird and inappropriate for a guy his age to be hooking up with “kids.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203331.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Sixteen Candles.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Soul Man. C. Thomas Howell in blackface playing a character taking advantage of black scholarship. He does learn his lesson in the movie, but it looks horrible on the surface.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203337.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Manhattan. Middle-aged Woody Allen is dating (and sleeping with) 17-year-old Mariel Hemingway.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203342.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. American Beauty. Especially not with Kevin Spacey.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203343.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. In Crazy, Stupid, Love, a 17-year-old girl gives her nude photos to a 13-year-old boy and its supposed to be a cute moment.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203344.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Boat Trip, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, or any of the other gay panic movies of the early 2000s, lol.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203345.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Leon the Professional. They def over-sexualized Matilda and had some very weird moments in it. Even if Leon rejected the advances, it still would be unacceptable for many people.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203346.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Everyone is saying 30+ year old movies but a lot of movies that came out even 10 years ago wouldn’t be okay today. For example, I just watched Pitch Perfect the other day for some reason. There’s a lesbian in the group and that’s literally the joke, that she’s gay. Then there’s a girl who likes to have sex and that’s the joke. And Fat Amy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203347.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. I feel like Pretty Woman would not be made today. I remember so many people just talking about how much they loved that movie. When I finally watched it, I was like “this is romanticizing prostitution.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203348.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Probably Juwanna Mann.

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Blazing Saddles. Looking back today, it’s got so many “fade out, fade back in” scene transitions! Sticks out like a sore thumb, even if you’re not normally the sort of person who pays attention to cinematography. You maybe see that sort of thing every once in a while today, but usually as a deliberate choice, not the default. Modern films usually use cuts, sometimes with diegetic sound from the upcoming scene playing early to let you know it’s coming, or find a way to incorporate it into the movement on-screen.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203350.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. MASH. Love the show, hate the movie. Used to get into public arguments about it with my ex. Him: “She hates MASH!! How can you hate MASH??? ”Me: “yeah, you know, the movie. Where they support a gay guys desire to kill himself and then drug and rape him as conversion therapy AND IT WORKS.” Good stuff.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203351.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Idiocracy. At this point, we can just watch the news.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87203352.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
