<span style="font-size:4em">1. The dreams of 13 Going on 30’s main character came true, and several elements prove it. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87205902.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

In one of the movie’s first scenes, the 13-year-old protagonist looks at a magazine with the keywords of what she wants to be in her adulthood: “30, flirtatious and prosperous”. Later, not only does the magazine’s message come true, but the same magazine inspires the decor of Jenna’s apartment when she’s 30.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87205903.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

In Pretty Woman, there’s a scene where Vivian (Julia Roberts) goes to dinner at an elegant restaurant. When she accidentally knocks over a snail, a waiter covers her sheer clumsiness by saying, “It happens all the time.” Mia (Anne Hathaway) in The Princess Diaries hears the exact phrase from the same waiter (Allan Kent) when she breaks a glass.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87205905.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

The scene in which the leads sing City of Stars in the apartment under a dim green light was created after director Damien Chazelle watched Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo the night before. Even at the last minute, he decided that Emma should wear a purple dress like Novak’s in that cinema classic.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87205907.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. The book “M.J.” reads may have a special connection to Peter Parker. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87205908.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

The book MJ reads in Spider-Man: Homecoming, Of Human Bondage (1915) by W. Somerset Maugham tells the story of an orphaned boy who is sent to live with his aunt and uncle, just as Peter Parker is.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87205901.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. One of the extras in Titanic is a historical consultant who helped the director. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87205909.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Historian Edward Kamuda, as a member of the Titanic Historical Society, served as a consultant on the historical facts in the film and appeared briefly as an extra in the scene where Jack and Margaret are walking on deck.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87205910.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

In The Conjuring, costumes worn by the couple Ed and Lorraine Warren have the same tone and pattern. For example, Ed’s tie and Lorraine’s skirt. Maybe they’re meant to reflect the connection that the couple had.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87205913.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
