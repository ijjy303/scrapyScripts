## <a href="#linky8" id="linky7">25 People Share the Nastiest Things They've Ever Done</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. When I was a kid, I went out with my friend and his fathers family. We ate Chinese and after my stomach was hurting. I was the first one outside so I tried to fart and sharted instead. I was about to run to the back of the building to wipe and throw boxers away (it was nighttime) but they came outside already. I didnt know what to do so I got back in the truck. It just happened to be the kind where you open the front to get back door open. I rode all the way home (30mins) with sh*tty pants. They didnt say anything but drove with all windows down. to make it worse, when I got home I had to climb over someone to get out because I was in the middle seat so my ass went right by the daughters face.-u/killing4food</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87139784.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. When I was a kid learning to ski, I begged my parents to let me go pee before a run but we were already in line for the chairlift. my oldest sister told me “if you have to pee really bad, that means it’s only a little bit! so just pee!”I trusted her blindly but probably pissed myself for a solid 2 minutes. filled up and flooded my ski boots. my parents were not happy because I was definitely old enough to know better-u/badluckie</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87139785.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Not really my fault, but in second grade, I got a stomach bug and my parents didn’t want to answer the phone, so the stupid nurse sent me back to class. We were at P.E at the time, and I got horribly sick again, just as I finished throwing up a kid had kicked a kickball. The sound it made as it slid through my vom is still with me to this day-u/htxxalxx</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87139786.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I accidentally sh*t my pants outside at some after-school program at my school, I decided instead of going inside it’d be better to hide in the tube slide, take the sh*t out of my pants and bury it in the sandbox.-u/Prestigious_Pass9599</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87139788.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. When I was in high school, I was so constipated, a poop as wide as an eggs length was stuck inside of me. I strained and pushed to no avail, and eventually had to stick a lubed-up finger inside, trying desperately to work my way around this monster and crack a chunk off. no dice. I ended up laying in the bathtub with my legs up in the air, butthole pointed straight at the hot water blasting from the tub faucet, praying that it would be dislodged. Eventually, enough chunks came off that I was able to poop it out, and it felt like dry, cracked birth.-u/robodook</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87139790.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Pissed myself while I was really drunk and couldnt admit it so poured all my alcohol on myself to make it seem like Id somehow gotten a bunch of liquid spilled on me. Since I was in a club that plan wasnt working, as you can imagine you cant just acquire that much alcohol for free and quickly, so I ended up trying to get into a sink in the bathroom and ended up getting taken away in an ambulance due to slipping. That sounds a lot less funny when I say it like that actually.-u/Haloperi-Doll</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87139792.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Doctor here, at one point in my career I was doing autopsies. Came in one day to the smell of bbq. I thought perhaps potluck or someone was cooking in the kitchen at work. Turned out there was a house fire and that was the smell of the victim. I performed the autopsy and despite my disgust, my mouth watered the entire time. Doing that type of work you learn to compartmentalize and leave your feelings at home, but he smelt so good I couldn’t eat meat for months and every so often I smell burnt meat and it takes me right back to it.-u/aliael14</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87139794.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Accidentally swallowed the crown on my front tooth after it came loose while I was eating taffy. I had the runs the next day and managed to shit it out while at work - I heard a clink in the toilet and I just knew. However, our toilets at work are automatic/use a motion sensor. I was TERRIFIED that I was going to move too quickly and make it flush, so I slowly crept off of the toilet and onto the bathroom floor - my asshole out in the open, covered in liquid turd - and crawled over to a box of latex gloves that we had in the bathroom. I somehow managed to avoid making the toilet flush, picked the crown out from the toilet, and called my dentist. He ran the crown through the sterilizer and put that $1400 bad boi right back into my mouth. I have no regrets.-u/Preskewl_Prostitewt</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87139798.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

In 5th grade, I used to sh*t tiny little turds in my pants, discreetly take out the turd and encapsulate it in my hand, get up to blow my nose, then I would put the turd in the tissue and throw it away in the trash can.

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I chugged a bottle of maple syrup like in Super Troopers.

Bateson appeared as a radiological technologist in a scene from the 1973 horror film The Exorcist, which was inspired when the film’s director, William Friedkin, watched him perform a cerebral angiography the previous year.

In 1979, Bateson was convicted of the murder of film industry journalist Addison Verrill and sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison; in 2003 he was released on parole, which ended after five years.

Prior to Bateson’s trial, police and prosecutors implicated him in a series of unsolved slayings of gay men in Manhattan, killings he had reportedly boasted about while in jail, bringing it up at his sentencing. However, no additional charges ever were brought against him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139821.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Nellie Bly . Went undercover and endured abuse to cover neglect and abuse in Blackwell’s asylum, went to Mexico and called out the dictator for going after the press and oppressing his people and then fleed/was exiled out of Mexico because of that, traveled the world in 70-something days to prove you could travel the world in 80 days or less (based off the the Jules Verne novel) , also did reporting on the Eastern European front in World War One and also was arrested after she was mistaken for a British Spy, and she did so much more !

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Witold Pilecki, a man so badass that he voluntarily and secretly went into Auschwitz as a prisoner and spy to gather information; while there he regularly made reports on conditions and also organized resistance. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138137.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Michael Collins.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Tiananmen Square Tank Man. Armed only with a grocery bag he fearlessly stood down a column of tanks to protest the brutal suppression of peaceful protest by the corrupt and morally bankrupt government of the People’s Republic of China. He dared to openly defy the leadership of China, a feat most modern world leaders who have militaries behind them don’t have the spine to do.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138142.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. John Brown, an abolitionist who organized a slave revolt, and was hanged for it.Absolute boss, yet still vilified as being too radical even today.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138143.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Welles Crowther, aka The Man In The Red Bandana. I’m sure most of us have thought about what it must have been like in the World Trade Center on 9/11 and it must have been debilitatingly petrifying. He was 24 years old working on the 104th floor as an equities trader. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138145.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">Made his way down to the sky lobby of the South Tower and found a badly burned woman, carried her down 17 floors, then went back upstairs to help guide others to the only passable stairwell. Stayed up there helping others and working with the fire department until the towers collapsed. He’s responsible for saving around 20 lives and [passed away] a damn hero.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138146.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Olga of Kiev. This lady lost her husband and when it was proposed she marry his murderer, she was like sure, send a delegation over so we can talk this out and they came. She had them dropped in a pit and buried them alive. Then she had another party of men sent to talk about the marriage, and they came. She said, hey, it was a long journey, why not come relax in this bathhouse and they did. She set the bathhouse on fire when they were in it. Then Olga went and sent the Drevilians another message, hey bring out the booze im coming to mourn my husbands death in your city. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138148.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

They turned the birds into mini matches by attaching sulphur to their legs, and then released them. Set the city on fire.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Lyudmila Mikhailovna Pavlichenko (née Belova; 12 June [O.S. 30 May] 1916 – 10 October 1974) was a Soviet sniper in the Red Army during World War II, credited with 309 confirmed [take outs], making her the most successful female sniper in history.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138151.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Lachhiman Gurung. On 12/13 May 1945 at Taungdaw, Burma [now Myanmar], Rifleman Lachhiman Gurung was manning the most forward post of his platoon which bore the brunt of an attack by at least 200 of the Japanese enemy. Twice he hurled back grenades which had fallen on his trench, but the third exploded in his right hand, blowing off his fingers, shattering his arm and severely wounding him in the face, body and right leg. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138152.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">His two comrades were also badly wounded but the rifleman, now alone and disregarding his wounds, loaded and fired his rifle with his left hand for four hours, calmly waiting for each attack which he met with fire at point blank range....Of the 87 enemy dead counted in the immediate vicinity of the Company locality, 31 lay in front of this Riflemans section, the key to the whole position. Had the enemy succeeded in over-running and occupying Rifleman Lachhiman Gurungs trench, the whole of the reverse slope position would have been completely dominated and turned.This Rifleman, by his magnificent example, so inspired his comrades to resist the enemy to the last, that, although surrounded and cut off for three days and two nights, they held and smashed every attack.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138153.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">His outstanding gallantry and extreme devotion to duty, in the face of almost overwhelming odds, were the main factors in the defeat of the enemy.TL;DR Guy gets surrounded by 200+ Japanese troops, his comrades get taken out and gets left alone, stabs his knife in the floor and declares no Japanese passes that line, throws back several grenades until one explodes, obliterates his hand, injures his arm and face so he just loads his rifle with his other hand and shoots at least 31 [unalive] (literally single handedly). </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138154.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">And this lasted for four hours, not a quick 10 minute burst.The Gurkhas are either brutally heroic or ridiculously insane (or probably both). They will be outmanned and outgunned but they will never be outfought. They would take a knife to a gunfight. And theyd probably win.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138144.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Theodora, Byzantine Empress. She started out as an actress, and the Emperor Justinian fell in love with her. Despite objections, they got married.During the Nike Revolts, her husband almost fled the city of Constantinople and nearly lost the empire. She stood up to him and reasoned with him, urging him not to leave. He stayed, put down the riots, and went on to lead the empire well for many years with Theodora by his side. His most lasting legacy was a massive overhaul and simplification of 1000 years of Roman/Byzantine law into what is now called the Justinian Code. Its often a model for modern systems of jurisprudence.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138138.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Joe Medicine Crow. The last legit Native American to earn the War Chief Title. In World War II he was a scout and wore traditional Crow Nation war paint and feathers. To become a war chief he had to touch an enemy without [unaliving] him, take an enemys weapon, lead a successful war party, and steal an enemys horse. He stole over 50 horses from the SS and earned a Bronze Star.Medicine Crow [passed away] at 102 years old. He was born with Woodrow Wilson in office and met Barack Obama before he [passed away].</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138156.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. How has no one said Giles Corey yet? He was accused of witchcraft along with his wife Martha Corey during the Salem Witch Trials. After being arrested, Corey refused to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. He was subjected to execution by pressing in an effort to force him to plead — the only example of such a sanction in American history — but instead [passed away] after two days of torture.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138157.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">As a result of his refusal to plead, on September 17, Sheriff George Corwin led Corey to a pit in the open field beside the jail and in accordance with the above process, before the Court and witnesses, stripped Giles of his clothing, laid him on the ground in the pit, and placed boards on his chest. Six men then lifted heavy stones, placing them one by one, on his stomach and chest. Giles Corey did not cry out, let alone make a plea. After two days, Giles was asked three times to plead innocent or guilty to witchcraft. Each time he replied, More weight.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138158.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Léo Major. Dude turned down his first Distinguished Combat Medal because he didnt like the general who was supposed to give it to him. All good though, he earned two more.

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Janusz Korczak. He was a military doctor during WW1, a completely committed amazing pedagogue, and the headmaster of a Jewish children’s home during WW2 in the Warsaw Ghetto. He was given several chances to flee to Palestine. Instead electing to stay with the children. Eventually, he accompanied them all the way into the gas chamber, to make sure they didn’t have to die alone and scared. It’s one level of bad-a**ery to [take out] for your cause. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138160.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">It’s a whole different level of badassery to walk towards certain death for several years, and endure hardship and starvation. Not for some grand cause. Not even to trade your life for someone elses. But only because you feel so much love towards your fellow man, to think it’s your duty to make sure they won’t have to die alone.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138161.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Cassius Marcellus Clay. He was an abolitionist politician and certified badass from Kentucky who freed all of his slaves upon inheriting his father’s plantation, letting them stay and paying them a fair wage. He was the OG progressive and did not take s**t from anyone. It’s no wonder Muhammad Ali was named after him. What is written below isn’t even 10% of the absolute badassery this man accomplished in his life. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138162.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">If you want the full story, check out the dollop episode in the comments.“Clay had a reputation as a rebel and a fighter. Due to threats on his life, he had become accustomed to carrying two pistols and a knife for protection. He installed a cannon to protect his home and office.”“In 1845, Clay began publishing an anti-slavery newspaper, True American, in Lexington, Kentucky. Within a month he received death threats, had to arm himself, and regularly barricaded the armored doors of his newspaper office for protection, besides setting up two four-pounder cannons inside.”“ During a political debate in 1843, he survived an assassination attempt by Sam Brown, a hired gun. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138163.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">The scabbard of Clays Bowie knife was tipped with silver, and in jerking the Bowie knife out in retaliation pulled this scabbard up so that it was just over his heart. Sam Browns bullet struck the scabbard and embedded itself in the silver. Despite being shot in the chest, Clay drew his Bowie knife, tackled Brown, cut out his eyes, and finally threw him over an embankment.” This “embankment” was actually the top of the Russell Cave (for which Russell Cave Rd is named after), trivia for any of you native Lexingtonians. It’s on Mt. Brilliant farm just south of Elkhorn Creek, where the event was hosted.“ </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138164.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky17" id="linky16">30 WTF Things People Weren't Supposed to See</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. When I bought my first pair of night vision goggles, I had them delivered to the TV station I worked at (not trusting my neighbors to leave my [stuff] alone).

So, I took a break and tried them out in the only truly dark room I could find. The mens room.

A coworker came in, flicked on the lights, and was startled to find me in the middle of the room, blinded by the sudden flash of normal light, brushing my teeth in the pitch dark with night vision goggles.

I had to go talk to HR about it. He was freaked out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141185.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I picked up a pizza and was super excited to eat it. I put it in the passenger seat of my car and said something along the lines of, Im gonna take you home and [mess] you up! I then realized that my window was open, and so was the window of the car next to me. The driver had watched and heard me talk dirty to a pizza.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141166.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I was in standstill traffic (ie car had been turned off, people where loitering outside of their cars) and I had a baby squirrel that I was hand rearing in my car. I fed it some puppy milk formula from a bottle, looked up and realised I had an audience of about twenty people gawking at me</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141167.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. One time, I was popping my friend’s back by picking him up from behind and bouncing him repeatedly. A teacher walked in the room and we both froze.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141168.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. When I was 14, I wanted to try to drink like a dog. I put a bowl on the floor and filled it with Fanta. My dad walked into my room where I was kneeling on the floor with my tongue in the bowl. He has never mentioned it since.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141169.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. My friend and I went to the movies and thought the place was empty, so we started running around and flailing our arms. Turns out, there was a man sitting in the far back corner the whole time just watching us.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141170.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I was called in to assist my wife with putting together a friends baby shower when her helper bailed at the last minute. My job was to prep the dirty diaper game which, if youve not heard of it, is played like this: an assortment of name brand candy bars and chocolates are unwrapped and then mushed into a diaper so as to resemble a babys dirty diaper. The game participants then assess the contents of each dirty diaper and have a guess at what candy bar might be lurking within. Whoever has the most correct answers wins.

Because I was called in at the last minute, I had to complete the task while at work...

So there I was, in my office, fifteen or so diapers laying open on my desk, sleeves rolled up, hurriedly rolling what appeared to be a gooey, nutty turd in my hands...when my boss walks in.

We make eye contact.

He glances at my work, looks at me as though I am dangerously unstable, then slowly steps back out of the office without saying a word.

Weve never spoken of it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141171.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Me, newlywed to my then-husband. Had to leave our apartment and move in with his somewhat disabled mother. Two weeks in, he and I are having sexy times in our bedroom. Specifically, hes going downtown and eating at the Y. MIL knocks and immediately opens the door, saying dinners on the table!. Awkward pause. Everyone freezes. His face is buried in my crotch. She stands shock still, then huffs, and says Well, I see youve already eaten, slams the door and goes away.

We giggle, recoup, and go to eat. Most awkward meal of my life.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141172.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. I once ran up the stairs on all fours. I hadnt realized that my best friend had already come over.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141173.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. As a toddler, my dog bit my diaper so, in retaliation, I bit my dog in the butt, and my mother caught me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141174.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I once had a coworker who worked at a customer site and had a crush on one of the women who worked there, too. One day, the woman came back from lunch and saw him pick up the cushion from her chair and sniff it. He was asked to leave.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141175.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. My father once saw me put my foot up on a chair and smack my own [butt]. My leg had fallen asleep.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141176.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. My ex-girlfriend once caught me playing her cat like a banjo. I had the cats front paws in my hand, and I strummed his tummy. The cat was purring so loud that it made her come in to see what was going on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141165.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. A UPS delivery guy once caught my grandma biting her toenails.

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I was like 13 or 14 in my room alone, my window wide opened, when I started to wonder if I ever got kissed what the other person would be seeing from their perspective, so I went up to my closet, which had those floor length mirrors and I started kissing the mirror, opening my eyes every once in a while to see if I looked at all attractive doing this, one of those times I opened my eyes I saw my brother outside my wide open window through the mirror looking at me with such a confused look on his face, I screamed and fell to the floor and hid in my room for a while.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141178.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. One of my old roommates walked in on me singing naked into a hairbrush once.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141179.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I can’t remember why, but I was in the shower and started loudly reciting the trailer for Gremlins 2. I stepped out of the bathroom and my mom was there pissing herself with laughter.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141180.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. I was once a server, and we have ranch dressing in bags, which were so satisfying to squish. I started doing it the way cats do it with their paws against something. I looked to my left and saw my manager staring at me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141181.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I was 14 getting it on with my hand and surround sound headphones...my dad walks in on me half asleep and mumbles, “what are you doin boy?” And shuts the door, but then COMES BACK IN TO VERIFY WHAT HE’S WITNESSED and has the audacity to say “you playin’ with yer meat?”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141182.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. In third grade, I went to the bathroom and, thinking I was alone, put my hands against the wall, leaned forward, and let out a long gigantic fart. I turned around and saw that some other kids had come in as I had released that massive fart.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141183.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Arguing with myself (well, not myself - the actual person just wasnt there, so I was standing in) in the mirror. With animated facial expressions and gestures. Lips moving, but with no sound. I now reserve these hypothetical arguments for the shower. When I am home alone.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141184.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. It was 3am and 15 year old me was taking a [poop] and got a blood nose. Now for context, I get real bad nose bleeds and usually just keep my head up and it goes away. Well I was bored. So I thought, “what if I just keep my head down and let it drip?” I know... very stupid. Blood was all over the floor. I had every intent to just clean it up with tissues and flush it, no evidence of my little experiment. What I didnt know was that my mum was actually awake and was waiting for me to finish in the toilet for her turn. I didnt lock the door because it was 3am and I didnt think I needed to. Well... she opens the door... “SemenDemon16 why are you taking so l-“ She sees the blood, starts freaking tf out. Thinks I’m either dead or dying. I start yelling trying to explain myself. Mum starts crying thinking shes gonna lose her son. My sister walks out her room from the crying and the yelling. Sees the blood. Freaks tf out as well. After a bit of panic I eventually explained my stupid experiment. I cleaned it up and we all went to bed. But I dont think anybody slept after that traumatic experience.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141186.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. One time my girlfriend and I had just left the house. She then remembered she needed something and went back in. Now, our house (Golders Green, London), was semi-detached with the neighbours house.

The neighbours motorbike was kind of in our shared front yard. Since I was waiting for my girlfriend, I decided to sit on the motorbike.

I heard the front door of the house close behind me, so, trying to be funny for my girlfriend, I leaned over the tank of the motorbike and started pretending to rev the throttle and making Vrrooom, Vroom motorbike noises. Like, really getting into it. I didnt hear any laughing, so I turned around and it was actually my neighbour standing there with this wtf look on his face.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141187.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Walking across the road to the dumpster with a bag of trash. One arm pulled into my hoodie. Flapping it like a wing, and slowly moving forward while going in circles. Saying to myself Flying in circles, flying in circles. Realizing that I was not circling in the right direction for the wing I had and reversing to circle oppositewise. Saying Flying in circles the wrong way.

Come back inside and find that my whole family had been watching me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141188.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. I once jokingly made an Instagram story of me pretending to shoot oranges out of my bum. My girl walked in on me in the bedroom with my drawers on throwing oranges so it looked like a POV of them popping out my butt.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141189.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. I was playing VR Chat with a skeleton skin on and I kept doing stupid dances that may or may not have involved a jerkoff motion. I heard my wifes voice from outside the headset go what the [hell]?!?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141190.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. Oh man. So I must have been about 12. I was in the car with my mom - to set the scene it was a three row soccer mom van and I was in the second row behind the passenger seat with my mom driving. Well since I was 12 I got my random hormone boner, strange and awkward enough right? Well I decide that I would pretend I was driving and that my boner was the stick shift... mom caught me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141191.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. I was a kid and creeped out by cousins creepy doll, one morning me and the doll were alone in her room and I grabbed the doll and started to shake it and while I was yelling at it that I knew it could talk, my cousin walked in and was like what are you doing?? And I brought the doll close to me and caressed it and said I was just kidding. She kept the doll away from me after that</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141192.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Was at the driveway at Wendys and had exact change as I was switching the money one hand to another the quarter slipped in between my legs and I went to grab it but it slipped down further and the guy comes to the window as I have one hand full with cash and the other hand in between my legs trying to grab the quarter. He looked and me and said Im not even going to ask and I just said the quarter fell between my legs I have exact change I got it and handed it to him pulled up to the next window to get my food and it set it what he thought he saw me doing. So embarrassing.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141193.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. When I was around 10 years old I was getting curious about sex so I decided to look it up in the dictionary. Wouldn’t you know it my ultra conservative mother walks in the room so I try to play it off like I was looking up the Heida Native American tribe. She called me out for being in the S’s but I doubled down and pretended i was possibly dyslexic. What a tangled web I wove.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87141194.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
