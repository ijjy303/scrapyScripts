## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">16 People Confess Incredibly Dark Family Secrets</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. My cousin married a serial killer, she had 2 boys with him and he tried to kill one of them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164258.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. My uncle had always been a raging alcoholic. A dangerous alcoholic. Well, my aunt married him anyways. They went to Germany for their honeymoon. Only he returned. We asked about the aunt and he pretended like he had no idea what we were talking about and how he has never gotten married.About five years later he married again despite us all trying to tell the woman not to. They went to Jamaica for their honeymoon. Same thing. He came back without her. Again pretended like hes never married. We began suspecting he was killing them. We called the police. They investigated. Nothing turned up. And then the years later, he married again. But COVID happened and they havent gone on a honeymoon.Were not sure shed believe us if we told her. So we have distanced ourselves from my uncle and he remains as the secret we dont talk about. We dont talk about Bruno type situation.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164246.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. My cousin is really my sister. My Aunt and Uncle couldnt have kids so my parents did for them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164249.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. My father is the youngest of 13 kids. But actually my grandparents only had 9 kids. Grandpa ran a farm and had a truck to deliver the produce from his and the surrounding farms. During WW2 he drove to Amsterdam to deliver food and secretly brought back Jewish boys. He hid them on his farm pretending they were his kids. Partially very nice of him, but he also just needed extra hands to work. After the war most of the boys went home to family members, but 4 of them had no remaining family. He officially adopted those 4 boys and just went on as if they had always been part of the family.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164245.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. My moms brother and her dad secretly don’t like her but its sad because she loves them so much</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164250.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. My grandmother on my moms side might be the s**ttiest person Ive ever met. She treats me like c**p because Im a teenager, a girl, and I remind her of my mom who she also tends to treat like c**p. She caused my uncles divorce because she MOVED IN with him and his then wife because shes a hoarder and cant even live in her house anymore. Shes completely ruined my youngest cousin and now he worships her in such a creepy way. Shes also racist, homophobic, sexist, anti-vax, etc. I just hate her. And we cant find a way to cut ties because when were in her state she finds a way to figure out that were there and guilts my parents into visiting. I hate her so much.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164251.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. My grandfather, my Moms Dad, was in the Merchant Marines in the 40s during WW2. It turns out that he was actually honorably discharged in July, 1945 and NOT November, 1945 like hed told everyone. He stayed in California for 4 months, unbeknownst to anyone. To earn extra money to bring home, he made 3 porn movies. He was 32-33 at the time, a big, robust, good looking man. He was married to my grandmother already and my Mom wasnt born until 1947, so they were childless still. We never found any of this out until 1984, when my Dad got a hold of some VHS vintage porn from the 40s and watched it with my Mom. My Mom recognized him right away. He had a very distinctive tattoo on the inside of his lower left forearm. A buddy of his was still alive at the time (1984) and still living in California, so my Mom got in touch. Sure enough, the friend (in his 70s) confirmed it and told her about the 3 movies. He starred in them himself and eventually sent her copies of the other 2 films. My grandfather died in 1969, and my grandmother in 1983. According to my Mom, she was sure no one had any clue.The money my grandfather earned helped to pay off the only car they had at the time and the rest helped to reestablish their nest egg.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164252.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I thought my dad had died but apparently he sent me away because I was born with a hearing problem and I wasnt perfect enough for him. I also didnt know I had a sister until four years ago, because my father decided that because my older brother was born, dear old dad could send my sister and I away, putting us both up for adoption. My mom got in the way though and managed to claim me, but I only recently got in touch with my sister and oldest brother, as we all met at Dads funeral after he passed from cancer. Im not sad that hes gone, but I dont hate him. He hated me, but I dont have a reason to hate him. Im not sad though.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164254.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. It’s actually f*cking awesome. Grandfathers great aunt by marriage ran the most notorious brothel in Sydney and had a lifelong feud with another brothel owner. She did go to the other madams funeral when she died, but as reported by the newspaper “just to make sure the old b***h stays in the ground”. The whole feud started over a dog breeding scam! RIP Tilly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164255.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. That I was sexually abused for many many years by an uncle. When I finally worked up the courage to tell my mother, I was forced to keep it a secret so my grandmother wouldnt know the horrible thing her son had done. Im still holding onto this to this day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164256.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. At twenty-one, when I asked my mother why I had no siblings, she confided that I had actually been born a twin and my brother had died because I choked him with my umbilical cord. She said I must never tell anyone or mention it to my father because he was still upset that it was the boy who had died. I had wanted a brother or sister all my life so was deeply sad and felt incredibly guilty to the point where I unsuccessfully attempted to end my life. (There was other stuff going on too - death of my boyfriend of five years - so I was already in a dark place.)Years later when I was carrying my own twins I began to realise that parts of her story seemed unusual and looked into my birth records. And heres the darkest bit - it turns out there never was a twin. I never confronted her.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164257.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Take your pick: The murderer, the murderer who got away, or the one who abused children to death (murdered) without suspicion.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164260.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. It’s not actually disturbing or anything but somehow the fact my great gran got admitted to a psyche ward because she became suicidal has become something no one talks about. She died 5 or so years ago and I only found out this year that 20 years ago she was admitted for a few months and both my mum and gran are really ashamed of this fact.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164261.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Quite some secrets here.- My mom and her sisters were abused by the same uncle when they were little. No one believed my mom when she spoke back in the day, and her sisters never said anything until last year, I think.- My grandad from my moms side was a alcoholic and a violent person. He hit my grandma A LOT, and also hit my uncles when they were little. Everyone in town knows him as a great and kind person, and the greatest friend.- We dont know who my dads father is. My grandma never said a word, never will. The man I call my grandpa on his side doesnt Even look like him. Other people know who my bio grandad is, but no one seems to remember the name. Also my dad doesnt care so idk who my actual grandad is and probably will never know.- Word says my grandad from my dad found his wife sleeping with this other man and set her on fire, leaving her a huge very visible scar on her belly, chest and neck, almost to her face. He denies it all.Theres more, but its getting quite long, so Ill leave it at that. Quite the family.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164262.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. My childhood home burnt down in 2009, when I was 8 years old, and my whole family knows the truth about what really happened that day... Lets say the fire was unaccidentaly accidental...</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164263.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. The darkest secret our family has is a few streaks of alcoholism here and there and the fact that were so boring that we dont have dark secrets.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164264.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky4" id="linky3">36 Scariest Moments People Still Don't Understand</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. As an officer on a reservation, we kept getting reports of a “tall man” at different places in a town on our reservation. One night we was able to catch him on a thermal camera. There was about 8-10 officers there. It was on a hill overlooking the town that was right below.

Tall, about 8-9 feet tall. Long dark hair. Human face. Really fast and quick

We sent officers that was in the town over to where it was walking towards a housing and we could see the officer get out and cross a fence and look with his flashlight but it looked like the figure was in a slight ravine to his side and couldn’t see it. We was giving directions on radio but our portable radios sucked and unless you was right next to your unit, they wouldn’t work. We watched as the tall figure walked right down the middle of the street and we could hear all the dogs in the housing start freaking out. It then walked out of sight.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165661.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. My dad used to work at a haunted house and wanted to add a ghost story to the website to get more people to come. He hired a medium to look around the place to see if she sensed anything. My dad didn’t really believe in the stuff though. Half way through the tour she asks if my father was missing a hammer. He said he was missing a lot of his tools. The medium said an old women passed in the floor above and had the hammer. My dad asked the spirit to give it back and the next day it was laying on the table. After that he left flowers for the spirit and it never took anything again</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165650.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Chupacabra are just coyotes with mange. Thats why as soon as Hollywood came up with a name the whole southwest was like S**t! Ive seen that!

They sure look like something paranormal. A healthy coyote doesnt act like one dying of mange, and the abnormal behavior is pretty creepy all on its own.

Most of my creepy experiences had pretty straightforward explanations. Like feeding the cat and then my cat walked in through the cat flap. There really was a second cat. He didnt look that much like mine when I was paying attention, but at first glance? Their heads and backs were close enough to make the mistake.

Another story isnt mine, but a friends.

A tropical storm hit and she was watching the weather for updates on the tornado watch/warnings when she heard her cat scratching and crying like mad at the front door. Horrified her pet was outside in the storm, she rushed downstairs to let her in. Her mom caught her just before she got to the door and stopped her. She said thats not our cat! And pointed to where their cat was cowering in a corner, eyes glued to the door.

They crept around to a bedroom window to look at the front porch and discovered it was a pair of bobcats that were scratching and crying at the door. After some frantic discussion, they opened the garage door partway to give them shelter so the bobcats wouldnt damage the door any more than they already had. It took a few minutes, but the bobcats left the shelter of the porch and entered the garage and ate the cat food there.

One of the bobcats gave birth in their garage that night. As soon as the storm passed and the water receded (about a day later), the bobcats carried the kittens back to their den. Based on where we sighted the kittens after that, we think the mama cat was in labor when the storm flooded her den. We think the bobcats had watched her cat come and go and figured any port in a storm.. Still, they were very creeped out for weeks after.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165651.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Went on fishing weekend with best bud in college. Stayed at his grandpas house in middle of bum f**k nowhere. We where sleeping in the sun room as it was a gorgeous night, and I was asking my friend bout the noises. Deer, foxes, and the like. Then we hear what is best described as a scream/wail…his grandpa came out of the house said “You boys just come on sleep on the couches now”. Never offered an explanation and I didn’t question s**t. 90yr old man with a 12gauge in hand says move…you move.

Edit: to y’all saying cougar, mountain Lion, owl, y’all might be right. But when grandpa who lived on the land for 80yrs comes out in his underpants shirtless and says get in the house. Yea don’t argue or question.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165652.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I’m convinced I’ve had something following me for years; possibly my entire life. I’ve always had weird things happening to me.

Weird experiences like as a kid (I don’t remember it but my mom told me about it) I would wake her up asking about the “person” in my doorway. Then later when my parents first started leaving me home alone I remember having to call them multiple times and have them rush home or someone come get me because I could swear I wasn’t alone in the house.

Living with my parents I would hear footsteps upstairs when no one else is home, once had my wife (while we were just dating) there and she heard it too. I would shut a door, and then later that door would be wide open

At Me and my wife’s first townhome things would fly of the shelf’s (like once a box of spaghetti noodles tucked away in the back of the pantry behind other things found it’s way to the ground without disturbing anything in front of it), pictures would fly off and away from walls but none of the others would even be rocking. Same footsteps upstairs. Weird things like my ukulele strumming itself in another room.

I have very specific and detailed stories but it’s a lot to type out, I don’t really care if anyone believes me but I know what I’ve seen and felt.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165653.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. It happened a few months ago. My 1 year old cat Salem, passed suddenly and I was so sad that I couldnt save his life. On that day I called my workplace and told them my grandpa passed away (he passed 20y ago) so I could cry at home I cried days because of him. One day I went to work and there was a guy who is doing witchcraft and he can see the energy / aura, etc. So I passed him with my ppt (powered pallet truck) and he looked at me and said Oh my god, who passed away my darling?  I told him my grandpa as I didnt want to blow my cover. And the guy said Are you sure it was your grandpa? Because a black cat is sitting on your truck and meowing very loud.. I was in shock. I didnt tell no one that I had a cat, didnt post anything on Facebook. Then he described me how that cat looks like with a white spot on the chest. He described my cat. My black cat.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165654.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Recently just started a new job where one of my duties is to lock up this building that was once a cancer hospital. I thought I was crazy but my stories have been confirmed by my co-workers/security camera footage.

Most wild experience? Was about 10pm and massive snowstorm outside so I expected some weird noises like howling from the wind etc. Im on the first floor which is just a labyrinth of hallways, making sure all the doors are locked, out of nowhere I heard what sounded like someone groaning, I attributed this to the wind outside. 5 minutes later, it happened again so I yelled Police whos there!, Show yourself! (Yes, I work for a PD). I radio for backup and confirmation the building is empty besides me, which is confirmed, backup never shows up due to the nuts snowstorm outside none of the sergeants felt like coming to help since they knew what was likely going on from watching cameras. Im finishing the 2nd floor and I heard what sounded like someone banging their head on the door downstairs or something, it was loud. I get downstairs and the locking mechanisms on the door I heard the noise come from is unlocked. This locking mechanism is only unlocked by 2 very specific keys (they dont even look like keys), myself and my Sarge on duty are the only ones that have em. At this point Im literally sweating and just f*****g hurry up back to the 2nd floor and lock up the fastest I have ever done so.

I get back to base and tell our dispatcher and Sgt what happened and theyre just sitting there laughing acknowledging my claims. They said that building is haunted as f**k and even students have experiences there in mid-day. My dispatcher then showed me the locking mechanism being unlocked (its a huge bar of metal, very noticeable on camera) and chills just ran down my back. She then showed me running down the hallway on my way to exit and one of the doors I locked swung open behind me, I didnt hear it because my gun belt and boots were making too much noise.

So yeah. Im not scared of being shot at but f**k ghosts, no time for those c**k suckers.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165655.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I posted this in another thread like this a while back

Several years ago, some friends and I were driving through one of the millions of small towns around the North/South Carolina border in the mountains. It was well after midnight. My friend looks behind us, and sees a pair of headlights coming up on us. Quickly. Like, easily 60-70 MPH when the limit is 25 or so. No signs of stopping so my friend pulls over to let the car past.

And what passes us is two lights. Just lights. Far too bright to be a firefly or any luminescent creature. As bright as headlights, if not brighter. Not attached to anything. No car, nothing. Just two lights booking it down the road.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165656.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. 30+ years ago, my mom’s stepdad passed away (my step-grandpa? he was basically her father; real dad walked out when she was nine).

There was a gathering at the house following the funeral.

Phone rings, my mom picks up, and hears a male caller say her name in an interrogative fashion(like “Susan?!?”). She was sure it was his voice, panicked, and hung up.

Caller didn’t call back, and the reverse dial pulled up a previous number to someone she knew who had called much earlier. So essentially the Call from Beyond didn’t happen as far as the phone company was concerned.

To this day, she believes it was him and regrets panicking and hanging up.

FWIW my mother is not religious/spiritual/etc.

Bonus story:

When my other grandfather passed away (2004, from complications following colon surgery. He was in his late 90s so it was a good run) he was in the hospital following his surgery. My dad and aunt had a feeling it might be a 50/50 chance he pulled through, given his age, so they were present.

He wakes up and asks when he got back. They ask him to explain.

He said he had a dream he was on a road trip in an airstream trailer with a buddy of his with whom he had a falling out 50+ years ago. He was driving and they were blinded by a bright light in the windshield. Then he woke up.

A few minutes later, he went to sleep and passed.

Come to find out he and his buddy had always wanted to do a cross country road trip, but has some kind of falling out and never spoke again. My grandma remembered it happening shortly after WWII. Must have weighed heavily on him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165657.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. My dad owned rental houses. Back in the 90s, my girlfriend and I’d go in after a renter left and rehab the house. One particular house, he’d purchased years ago with the renter already in the house. When they passed away, we went in and started in the bedrooms, first painting then cutting out the carpets. We noticed we kept losing our carpet cutters but thought we’d accidentally rolled them up in the carpets. So we got fluorescent orange cutters. Nope still can’t find them. Then we pull the living room carpet. Several large stains that look exactly like dried blood are soaked into the cork underfloor. OK, might be stain, or someone butchered a chicken in the living room-No telling. But as I’m painting a living room wall, I see a human shaped shadow coast across the wall. I think someone is walking around the house, maybe a meter reader. I run outside and no one is there, up or down the street. I run around the house. NO ONE is there. We finish in a big hurry and get paid. My dad calls later and asks what we used to clean with because the house is full of flies. I go back wash every flat surface with bleach and water. Next day- full of flies. It’s a house built on a concrete slab, so no crawl space. He decides they must be getting in through a crack in the slab and fills the cracks with silica. Nope still flies. I vacuumed up hundreds of dead flies. He had lived through the depression and fought in WWII. He raised 10 kids and lived to tell. But he sold that cursed house in a second. He didn’t believe in that s**t but he wasn’t a fool.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165658.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. One day my wife came home, we were living in an apartment in midtown. It’s about 10:00 pm and I was taking the trash to the dumpster in the alley behind my complex. The complex had only 6 two story apartments, the front door of each facing south. We lived in #5, and if you were to walk outside, once you open the door there’s a little raised landing where you’d put a welcome mat, step off the landing, you’re on a walkway, and you have to go either left or right because there’s a very tall wooden fence separating the complex from the large house next door. So if you turn right and walk down past apartments #4-1 you run into a gate, go through a gate, and you’re now on one of the main streets in midtown. If you were to turn left coming out of the apartment, you will pass apartment #6, then the laundry room, and immediately into a rod iron gate, and immediately on the other side is the dumpster. It’s a very short distance from my door to the dumpster and with nothing to obstruct your view, you can see from the dumpster all the way down the length of the walkway to the gate at the other end of the complex. The entire area is well lit, literally every unit would turn their front porch light on every night, and there is a street light right where the dumpster is, and one right on the other side of the street side gate. So it was easy to see my wife open the gate and head up the walkway towards our apartment. I waved at her and have no idea how she didn’t see me, and I thought about yelling but didn’t want to scare her or startle the neighbors. I was done emptying the garbage so I just started walking the short distance to her. As I’m walking up, I see the door to our apartment open, of course I figured she opened it but it was dark so I didn’t actually SEE her do it, then she kind of leans in and I could hear her calling my name, but she would not walk in to the apartment, our own apartment, so why not walk right in, right? Then, when I got behind her and said hi she became frantic, asking me how the f**k did you do that, how did you get back outside?!? I explained I’d been at the dumpster emptying the trash, to which she interrupted me said “no, you opened the door for me and walked upstairs, I called after you and you turned your head and looked at me but didnt say anything and just kept walking, and then she started crying. I searched the apartment, found nothing. We moved about 6 months later to the house we’re at now. One day shortly after we moved in, my wife thought she saw me walk past the windows that look into the back yard from the kitchen, but it wasn’t me, and again she said it looked just like me, and that it walked all the way around the house before disappearing, and then she realized I was in the bedroom.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165659.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. When my youngest son was about 3 years old we were eating out in town and he got a bit restless.
I decided to take him for a walk and as I held a door open he got away from me and made a break for it(pedestrian area so safe)
He bolted into an adjacent site which had a ruined chapel/almshouses with info boards for tourists.
I found him staring up at the Chapel ruins.
‘What are you doing,mate?’
His reply?…..’A long time ago I got married here’
‘What!?’
‘A long time ago……’
Then a switch flicked,he was a 3 year old with energy to burn and was off running again.
Shook me to my core</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165660.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. This happened to me when I was 6. I was in my bed sound asleep when I felt the mattress beside me slowly shift as if someone was laying beside me. I opened my eyes and there was a full grown adult woman beside me.

She wasnt particularly scary, just normal looking but she was a strange person in my bed. Of course I opened my mouth to scream but before I did she put her finger to her lips as if to tell me to be quiet. Her eyes looked very frightened and she seemed to be silently pleading for me to keep quiet.

Of course I screamed my guts out and I heard my parents getting up out of their bed. The strange woman just looked very sad, her eyes were full of tears. Dad turned my bedroom light on and as soon as he did she just wasnt there anymore. No sign of her at all. I slept in my parents room that night. I was very scared but even more so I had a deep feeling of sadness.

That was decades ago and I still remember it clearly.

Ive had a few run ins like that, different people though, never that same woman.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165662.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. This is my sisters story and idk if it is paranormal or not, but she thought it was a lil spooky.


She lived in a tiny lil studio apartment one summer and came home to quickly get a bite to eat, wash up and go back out with friends.
She puts some bread in the toaster and goes into bathroom to wash face/do makeup etc. She hears the toaster pop and comes out to get it, but the toast is nowhere to be found. She checked the floors, counters everywhere and it was just gone. Toaster was still hot. Really weirded her out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165663.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Not sure this counts but I once saw a cat, a hare, a rat, a fox, a seagull and a weasel all standing stock still on a b road near Appleby in late summer a couple of years ago. The weird thing was they were totally still in a perfect circle in the road facing each other, I approached in my car and had to stop, I waited a few seconds then they all seemed to snap out of it and legged it in different directions into the surrounding fields. So odd Ive never been able to work out what they were doing.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165664.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. My first year of university a girl I lived with had her friend over one night. He’d been shooting footage on London Bridge at 3AM to get some shots of it abandoned at night. He was really riled up about something and insisted we watch it with the audio up all the way and listen closely.

Around the 1 minute mark I heard a low, deeply menacing voice whisper slowly “as you walk the devil’s path..” then something unintelligible… then “…death.” It felt so final and evil. He turned to us and said, “did you hear it?” I said I’d heard a voice. “What did it say?” I told him what I’d heard.

His face went white. “You heard the exact same thing as me. You’re not the first.” My housemate said she’d heard the same thing as well. He hadn’t heard the voice when he was on the bridge, only when he was working on the audio, but he’d shown it to other people who had heard the same thing.

I don’t really have any other paranormal encounters so this one might not stand out, but I’m generally wary of paranormal s**t and this still scared me. There was some sort of presence on that bridge at night. It wanted to make itself known. I don’t ever want to know what it was.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165665.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. This is pretty mild, but I took my dog for a walk, got home, went to the corner store 5 minutes away. When I came back opened the door and my whole house smelled like perfume. Locked gate, locked house, security cameras and a dog that barks at everything. I live alone, nobody stopped by and my house smelled like someone ran around spraying Chanel number 5. It doesnt sound believable, Ill never be able to explain it, but it happened.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165666.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Working on ships, some are pretty old and you hear some weird stories.


4 years ago during a South American season, I used to hang out with the Brazilians, fun and cool people, one was the gift shop manager.

Hed rant and rant about how his team is lazy and how they keep trying to weasel out of working because they claim to see a little girl running around the gift shop, one night, we were having coffee with the head of the Photography department and hes extra salty, talking about how hell have to do an extra couple of hours because of his team.

In the middle of the night, I get a call from the Photo manager, she tells me our friend in her cabin crying and shivering, I run over, thinking he got some bad news from home or something.

Turns out he was working in his office, the door faces a long mirror that covers most of the wall (clothes section) and after hearing giggling, he saw the shadow of a child through the reflection, as if she was leaning to look into the door while trying to hide, only in the reflection, he says he jumped up and ran out, the giggling and sounds of tiny feet running around the shop and into the Casino (same deck).

Im not big into the paranormal, but the following day I mentioned this to my boss and she told me that about 20 years back, a little girl came out of the theatre with her parents, she was running ahead of them, around the gift shop, but eventually she went into the Casino, coming out at the Atrium, a drop with Glass lifts that go from Deck 12 to 5, so a good drop, she leaned over the railing to look down, lost her balance and fell, breaking her neck on impact and passing.

Apparently it was a common sighting at the Shop and Casino.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165667.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I was reading a library book before bed one night when I was a teenager. It was something really boring I had checked out for a history project for school and I couldnt keep my eyes open. I fell asleep with it on my bed. I had like a sleep paralysis event happen and I watched this shadowy figure of a man walk into my room, look around, pick up a few knick-knacks and put them back down. It was so terrifying, my entire body was screaming to move but I couldnt - not even my fingers. I just wanted to scream for help- but nothing happened, no matter how desperately I tried. I finally got enough courage to look at the man but he wouldnt come into focus for some reason... he was just a shadow, like he wasnt fully there. He came up to the side of my bed and stood over me, looking down at me for what felt like forever. I was so terrified but I couldnt move a muscle. Then he reached down, grabbed my library book, and turned, walking out of my room. I never found that library book, ever, after tearing apart my room and my house.

My mom said it was a coping dream for losing the book but I distinctly remember falling asleep reading it that night and I even had sent a text to my boyfriend that night saying that I wished I had chosen a different book because this ome was putting me to sleep. I had to pay a fine and everything!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165668.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. At a cemetery in rural Thailand: blue light orbs that jumped from gravestones to the top of the trees.

In Malaysia: seeing a crowd of ragged people crossing a busy intersection. The other three people in the car didnt see anything. This happened in board daylight.

Etc.

Ive been seeing and hearing things since a young age. Tried a lot of things to stop it but none worked. So I just live with it because it doesnt seem to have any detrimental effect on me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165669.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Never believed in ghosts, openly mocked people that did. Went camping and my wife and I were going to sleep in the pole barn. Brought the dog into the barn and immediately she was freaking out. Very uncommon for such a relaxed and tired dog. Walking around the air mattress and whining. After about 5 minutes of me telling her to calm down, a light shines through the aluminum siding.

Imagine holding a flashlight on the other side of a curtain doing a figure 8. It seemed like there was some sort of flashlight shining through the aluminum door.

I dont mention anything for a few minutes as Im questioning everything Ive ever known to be true. My wife asks Do you see that?. I say Oh f**k, you see it too?. At that exact moment I realized we both saw it, it turned into the brightest orb Ive ever seen. Lit up the whole barn as if it was daytime. Then it started floating towards us. I yelled at my wife to run and the dog was already at the door. We ran as fast as we could and didnt dare go back to get the air mattress. Our dog never would walk in that pole barn again.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165670.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. I saw a UFO when I was 11 years old. I will swear on this until the day I die.

It was around 9:00-9:30 at night, and it was the spring time. I was wide awake, completely sober, not on any meds.

I looked out the window, and in between my house and my neighbors house were a bunch of trees. It was a wooded area. Well, on the ground in this wooded area was a UFO. Except, the physical surroundings were unaffected. None of the trees were crushed. This UFO sat there for about 5-10 minutes, then slowly took off in the air. In just went around in circles as it got higher, and as it got higher, the circles got wider. This lasted another 5 minutes or so until it vanished</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165671.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Ever since I was 10, I’ve always encountered a sleep paralysis episode once a month. This experience I will never forget. I went to sleep really early then I usually do. Probably around 7 or so. I woke up at 2 in the morning and found out I couldn’t move. I tried calling my mom and dad but nothing. Living in a big room was always unsettling for me since there were lots of shadowy corners. I’m saying this because in one corner there was a long dark black figure.

It had no facial features from what I remember. But the legs and that huge long body is what terrified me the most. It crept closer and closer. Every movement felt like hours. Then it got to the side of my bed and their long finger was pointed at me. I closed my eyes and I think that’s when I passed out. I woke up a few hours later at 4 and it was still dark. The figure was gone though. I didn’t get out of my bed or anything. I just cried and cried and cried. I stayed up the rest of the night looking at the corners every second.

The trauma from that was so bad that I had to go see a therapist and my mom pulled me out of school for a few days so I could relax and be to myself. Every now and then I think about that day. And it makes me cry. The thought of me thinking I would die or being taken still scares me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165672.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. My dad had s**t going on in his house, so much s**t that almost every kid who would come in, myself, my sisters, my brother and my dad have all had multiple experiences in there.

I remember one time, I was going upstairs to have a shower. The bathroom was the end of the hallway and on the way to it, I had to pass by the room I shared with my sisters when I was over for the weekends. As I passed by, I seen something sit up on the bottom bunk (we had bunk beds in there) out of the corner of my eye. This thing looked like a little girl. She had pale skin, short black hair that was cut in a bob style with straight bangs covering her forehead, and her eyes were these massive circles with large black dots in the center for pupils. She was facing sideways so her right shoulder was facing me when she turned her head, the other half of her body looked like it was under the blankets.

I remember getting such an intense feeling of fear that I went back downstairs and refused to go upstairs at all or even sleep in the house. My dad had to set up the camping tent in the backyard for the rest of the weekend

If this occurrence had been nothing/me just seeing things that werent there, I feel like I shouldnt still remember it in perfect detail at the age I am now (seen it when I was maybe 6 or so. Im 23 now)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165673.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. I was on a beach called Butterfly beach in Montecito California. It was late at night and I was walking with a gf at the time. We looked at the beach from an elevated walkway and noticed a small black humanoid creature about 4 feet tall with a massive spherical head maybe 2-3 ft in diameter.

The moon caught it just right and it reflected on its spherical head. My gf at the time screamed and the thing jumped into the ocean and swam away. It was just hanging out in the beach watching the moonlight I guess. Nothing I have googled has explained this thing we saw.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165674.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Ive told this story before but while my husband and I were driving through the middle of nowhere Nevada in the middle of the night, we swore we saw a gargoyle or something fly across the highway. It had a huge wingspan, 2 arms, and 2 legs. We only saw it for a second as it crossed in front of our car but we both saw the same thing. It could have been some sort of massive bat I guess but gargoyle was definitely what came to mind.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165675.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. One time as a teenager I was making something to eat and randomly heard a bunch of birds chirping super loud. I look up and into the living room and see at least 20 “spirit” birds flying around the room. Think the old style white light effects they used for Tinkerbell. I was a little weirded out (not too much, at that point I was used to hearing/seeing spirits) and was also hearing “say hi to mom!”. So I asked her. I said, “hey mom? Did you ever have birds? Like, lots of birds? Before I was born?” She stopped and looked very confused. She said, “Yeah. I had close to 2 dozen wild parakeets when I was a teenager. Why?”
I told her because they were all flying around the living room saying hi right then. She had never mentioned before having had birds.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165676.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. I remember as a kid I would explore old abandoned houses and buildings. One time I heard a rattling noise while in this two story house. Followed the sound upstairs and saw a leather belt on the ground, writhing around and twisting like a serpent. I was too scared to touch it and ran away. There was nothing in that room that could have caused it, no windows for drafts or anything. Sometimes I think I just dreamed it because it was so long ago but it felt so real and I can remember all the details.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165677.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. My best friend and I found a store that didnt exist.


It was full of pagan items and things like it, such as zodiac sign necklaces, candles, and books. It was downtown in our small city, and we were both familiar with the area and had never seen this store before. We ended up not buying anything because we were a couple of broke teenagers, but we did agree that we were going to return when we had more money.


Except that when we did have more money, maybe two weeks later, that store was gone. It wasnt that the owner had closed up and left an empty space behind. The doorway no longer existed. It hadnt been freshly bricked over or anything, it just wasnt there.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165678.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. I was working at a summer camp in the PNW one year. On the second or third night there, I was jogging alone back from the staff campfire to the cabin, where the campers and my co-counselor slept. Im walking in this big grassy throughway that has some taller reeds separating it from a shore of the Puget Sound. Its probably... 2am? Full moon.

As Im jogging I see this... person. In the reeds. Its wearing a white gown, and it has no face, just hair. I only notice it because, as I approached it, it stood up from a crouched position, backed up joltily a few steps, then crouched down again, but I could still see it crouching there, like it was waiting. Its movements told me that it was not human. My knees gave out, and I felt flooded with fear as I collapsed. I tried to run back to my cabin but my legs would. not. work. I crawled and scrambled there on all fours. I tried to scream but no sound came out. Just gasping. I finally got to my cabin and fumbled with the doorknob for what felt like a minute before I could open it. I closed the door and stood there waiting for a while inside. I didnt hear anything, but I barely slept.

At some point later that night I remember laughing, thinking Oh, it was just one of the campers peeing! I was hysterically laughing at myself for like twenty minutes, then fell asleep.

Next morning though, I realize that no campers returned to the cabin that could have potentially been out there peeing that night. I asked all of them, and all of them said they hadnt gone out to pee the previous night.

Ill add that this was a camp that was *overtly* for nonreligious, skeptically minded staff and campers, of which I was and still largely am, but I have no explanation for what I saw that night. Still scares the s**t out of me just typing this.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165679.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">31. ok, so not really a cryptid, but i reckon ive seen something undocumented:

my wife and i were driving along the highway in remote northern west australia. we come around a corner from behind a hill and theres this massive bird in the middle of the highway ripping into a kangaroo. we slam on the brakes to avoid hitting it and it spreads its wings and flies away. this things wingspan was easily longer than our corolla and the top of the bonnet was probably 2/3 the height of it standing on the road. it looked like a type of eagle.

now, a wedge tail eagle is supposed to be the biggest flighted bird in the world. and ive seen wedgetails, right up close and trained to do tricks. this thing was easily at least 4 times the size as that. it could easily lift off with a dog or small child.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165680.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">32. So i was taking a shower when i suddenly heard a faint voice, like a woman sobbing, i got out almost immediately. Apparently my step dad had experienced the same thing, and had also seen what he thought was a girl sitting on his side of the bed, but me and my mom were both out of state at the time. Our things will randomly go missing and reappear as well</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165681.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">33. So mine is dumb, but its the closest Ive got. Summer of 2020 I had just finished up working on an outdoor drive-in concert, and was standing around chatting with the rest of the crew as the audience cleared out. Mid conversation, I saw a woman walk behind the group wheeling a bicycle (I was the only one facing her). I dont know what came over me, but as soon as I saw her I said out loud thats a f*****g ghost, when I looked again she was gone.

What makes bizarre to me is that it was perfectly reasonable for there to be a woman wheeling a bicycle through the parking lot, a big concert had just ended so its not surprising. What was weird was that when I saw this totally normal thing my brain immediately and unequivocally recognized her as a ghost.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165682.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">34. Back in June of 2020 my friend, his wife, my dad and some of my friends friends all went on a ghost investigation at Benson Grist Mill. Its a 100+ year old mill that was made by one of the leaders of the mormon church at the time.

Once I got onto the property I instantly felt like I had an apple lodged in my throat. I thought it was anxiety and I just brushed it off. We entered into a house that was on the property and tried to get an evp recording. I felt like something was trying to shove me to the ground.

I then met up with my friend in the basement of the mill and I began to cry for no reason. His wife helped me get out of the mill and calm down. After about 30 minutes I felt the presence of a child telling me to go to the school house. Its as if the child was trying to comfort me.

## <a href="#linky14" id="linky13">28 WTF Moments in History We Don't Talk About</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. In the 1970s, a film team was filming an episode of The Six Million Dollar Man at an amusement park fun house. A stage hand was moving a fake wax figure on a rope when one arm fell off, revealing human flesh and bone underneath. Following an autopsy, it was discovered to be the body of a 60-year-old outlaw who had been taxidermied to some extent.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164860.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. The Filipino Zoo Girl, which was on display in the Coney Island Zoo in 1914, is one that stands out to me. People threw peanuts at her while she was restrained by ropes. Its sad to witness anything like that, especially when it involves a child so young. Many people are unaware that [human zoos] occurred, but they are a horrible chapter in human history. Whats amazing is that some have survived into the twenty-first century, but not as cruelly as they once were.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164850.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The Childrens Blizzard. It occurred in January 1888 on an unseasonably warm day. The weather was nice and many school-kids were tricked into not wearing coats or jackets to school, some only in short sleeves. While the kids were in class, the weather outside changed dramatically from warm and sunny at noon to dark and heavy like a thunderstorm, with heavy winds and visibility at 3 steps by 3 pm. Children left school to go home and do their chores (this was in Minnesota) and were expected to milk the cows and do whatever else was involved in the family farm. But they got lost in the darkness and snow and the wind and many froze to death in their town, just yards from houses or other sources of refuge. 235 people, mostly children died.There is a novel about the blizzard out now, and there is a nonfiction book about the event as well. I think they have the same title, different authors:The Childrens Blizzard (Nonfiction by David Laskin)The Childrens Blizzard (Fiction by Melanie Benjamin)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164851.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Jellyboys.During the 1800s British noblemen in India would use so called jellyboys (local boys smeared in jam) to walk beside them attracting all the bugs, flies and mosquitoes, creating a neat golfing experience for the nobility and a not so neat experience for the boys.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164852.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Magdalene asylums, also known as Magdalene laundries. Places of reform for women that didnt fit the idea of a good upstanding citizen. The most well known ones were in Ireland. The women and girls were abused and mistreated by asylum staff, most of whom were nuns.Mass graves, selling these womens children to people in other countries, blocking any parental rights... Theres apparently at least one movie coming out, a lot of stories about it, and so many people sharing stories from their mothers and grandmothers. I guess its more well known than I first thought.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164853.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The Radium Girls. In the 1920s, they worked at a watch company painting the hours on the watches using radium, a radioactive element that glows in the dark. They did this with no PPE and werent told radium is dangerous. Meanwhile, the chemists had full PPE and worked in a sealed environment.Worse, they were instructed to lick the tip of the brush to make a very fine point. Some of them would paint their nails or their teeth with it for fun when they went out at night.They would develop cancer whenever the paint touched, and many of them had such decay in their jaws that their mandibles had to be held on with bandages.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164854.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. In my familys region in Africa they used to carry out the capital punishment by snakebite.Just a snakebite to each ankle, and then letting the man spend his remaining time with his family before he [passed away] (under supervision).I thought it sounded sort of humane in a way, like our lethal injections, but apparently they say it was one of the most horrific ways that existed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164855.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. The Vipeholm Experiment.Sweden are mostly known as a not very scary country. With good and mostly accessible dental care.The Vipeholm experiments were a series of human experiments where patients of Vipeholm Hospital for the intellectually disabled in Lund, Sweden, were fed large amounts of sweets to provoke dental caries (1945–1955). The experiments were sponsored both by the sugar industry and the dentist community, in an effort to determine whether carbohydrates affected the formation of cavities.The experiments provided extensive knowledge about dental health and resulted in enough empirical data to link the intake of sugar to dental caries.[1] However, today they are considered to have violated the principles of medical ethics.Hey, you are institutionalized and suffering and powerless - lets make your teeth rot out of your skull.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. The sad case of Ota Benga. He was a “pygmy” boy from the Congo who was essentially captured and brought to the USA to be displayed in freak shows. He had undergone tribal customs such as having his teeth filed into points before his capture.He eventually got out of the carnivals and dreamed of returning to Africa, then WWI happened, making the trip impossible for the foreseeable future.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Khuk Khi Kai, or the Chicken Poop Prison in Thailand. Used by French forces to hold political prisoners (rebellious Thai people) in the Chanthaburi region.The long-standing impacts of this much-feared torture are still felt in the region today - theres a Thai saying for those who buck authority that roughly translates to Be careful not to get caught in a chicken poop prison. I learned about this prison from my parents who learned about it from theirs.How it worked, was there was a small, 2-story prison. Bottom floor houses the prisoners, and the top floor is basically a huge chicken coop.The grated floor/ceiling ensures that the chicken poop falls onto the prisoners below.Apparently, even though the maximum sentence in Khuk Khi Kai was around a week, it was one of the most feared punishments there was.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164858.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. The Ideal Maternity Home here in Canada. From the 1920s till the 1940s, they took in babies from unwed mothers and they were selling them especially to desperate jewish families in New Jersey (adoption was illegal in the US back then).It was later discovered that the people who ran this business would starve the unmarketable babies by feeding them only molasses and water (the babies would last around 2 weeks on this diet). They put the corpses in wooden box often used for butter and thats why the victims are called the Butterbox Babies. The boxes were either buried on the property or at sea or burned in the home furnace. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164859.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> The parents who gave their child to this maternity home would go back and see how their child is doing but were told the child has died when in fact it had been sold to adopting parents. Between 400 and 600 died in that home and at least a thousand were adopted but sadly, the adopted babies often suffered from diseases because of the unsanitary conditions and lack of care at the home.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164861.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. The massacre of kalavrita. It is a village is Greece. The Germans entered it and rounded up all the male villagers in a field. They then shot them all with machine guns. After that they got the children and women and put them in the church. When everyone was inside, they locked the doors and set fire to the church. Around 20 minutes into the burning, a German soldier couldn’t take it anymore and opened the doors. Around half of the people escaped the fire but the rest perished. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164862.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> The German soldier was shot for this, and if you go to kalavrita today his name is on the memorial. No one was punished for this apart from the leader of the division, who I was told by my grandmother that he died in a gulag. But everyone else got away with it. It is sad that no one knows about this, as things like this happened all over Greece and Russia and Poland. I only know about this because my Great grandmother was one who escaped in the church. This massacre was in retaliation for the villagers supporting the local resistance force, which had recently [unalived] about 10 nazis.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164863.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. The January 1945 sinking of the MV Wilhelm Gustloff. It was a German ship carrying fleeing Germans from the Eastern Front to the West through the Baltic Sea. It was sunk by the Soviet Navy shorty after setting sail. The total death toll is unknown but estimated at over 9000 since there were so many stowaways. It is the worst maritime disaster ever, several times more than the Titanic.It didnt get nearly the press because they were the enemy so who cares, and the Nazi media certainly didnt report it because theyre at the waning days of a war theyre badly losing so the last thing they need is more hits to their already sinking morale.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164849.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. The Cadaver Synod.Basically the pope had a previous Popes corpse exhumed so the corpse could stand trial for something made up. So they dug up his bloated 7 month old corpse and convicted him, retroactively nullifying his papacy. Then they dumped his bloated and convicted corpse in a river. The people got pissed and overthrew the pope, who was strangled in prison. The next pope came along and had the corpse collected from the river and its papacy posthumously reinstated.897 was a crazy year.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164864.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Human “experimentation” by Japanese Unit 731 during WWII, committed primarily against innocent Chinese civilians. Nothing I’ve ever heard of in my life, including in fiction, is darker than the horrors committed for years by Unit 731, a military biological and chemical weapons research division of the Japanese Imperial military.There’s not enough room in a Reddit post to list half of it, but here’s a taste: Dissections of living babies, pregnant women, etc. without anesthesia (also known as a vivisection) usually after they had been deliberately exposed and left to suffer from horrible diseases, chemical and biological weapons, and so on. Freezing limbs off of victims. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164865.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">Horror-movie sadistic surgeries involving cutting off limbs and attaching them to the wrong sides of a victim, or removing organs and connecting the tubes back together without the organs to see what would happen, such as running the esophagus straight to the intestines with no stomach in between.Not to mention the fact that the victims were routinely tortured for the sake of torture, without even the flimsy excuse of “science” being conducted.And we’re talking about thousands upon thousands of victims, usually hapless Chinese civilians, political prisoners, POWs, and the homeless, over the course of years in huge facilities with thousands of staff committing these atrocities.The icing on the cake? General MacArthur and the rest of the US government found out about it when they captured Japan — and they granted Unit 731 immunity for their war crimes so long as they share their findings with America and ONLY America. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164866.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">Many of the former Unit 731 members even went on to have very successful and profitable futures in Japan after the war.Edit: Based on a couple of the comments I’ve gotten where people are making judgement calls about the modern day Japanese for this - I’d just like to make clear that I hold no prejudice against the Japanese, and I’m certainly not encouraging others to — every country and people has truly horrific pasts, and almost all of them sweep it under the rug as best they can. Even in our generation. We can argue that torture conducted by US soldiers in Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib, for example, aren’t half as bad, or were more justified, but ultimately torture is torture and sadism is sadism. A culture or government that begins to permit such things and justify them is well on its way down the spiral with enough motivation. Let’s not fool ourselves into comforting racism or nationalism that our countries or people are incapable of atrocities of our own, even today.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164867.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. The New London School Explosion. On the afternoon of March 18, 1937, the shop teacher at the school in New London, TX turned on an electric sander. Unbeknownst to him, there was a massive natural gas leak under the school. The sander sparked, which ignited the gas and caused a massive explosion that [unalived] almost 300 students and teachers. It was absolutely horrific. The force of the explosion was so great that a two ton block of concrete crushed a car parked 200 feet away. This event is actually why natural gas has a smell now. They started adding it after the explosion so that something like this couldn’t ever happen again.My grandfather was actually one of the survivors of the explosion. He never talked about it, even to his own family, so I didn’t really know too much about it (other than the fact that he’d survived) until after his death. Toward the end of his life, he’d suffered a series of strokes that left him pretty physically incapacitated, so my dad had given him a voice-activated tape recorder and suggested maybe he could record his memoirs for his grandkids to listen to someday. 12 Life Tips Everyone Should KnowAs it turns out, he did. We have hours and hours of cassette tapes of him telling the story of his (actually very interesting) life, including a big section on the New London school explosion. For the sake of everyone’s privacy, I’ll call my grandfather Papa and use an initial for anyone else.Papa was in eighth grade when it happened, in his English class at about 3:00 PM on a Thursday afternoon. At the beginning of class, Papa and his buddy T had been messing around and being loud in the back of the classroom (as eighth grade boys often do). His teacher, Miss M, had enough of their disruptions and made Papa switch seats with another student. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164869.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">He moved into the girl’s desk in the front row, and she moved back into his desk in the back of the room. When the school exploded, they were taking a test on the book Ivanhoe. Papa was knocked out for a short time, and when he woke up, he couldn’t see anything because the dust was so thick. He looked down and saw that his pencil had blown clear through his hand. When the dust cleared, he saw that the whole back of the room was gone. I won’t go into details, but there were bodies (and parts of bodies) everywhere. The students in the front half of the room survived. The students in the back half did not. That included Papa’s friend T and the little girl who’d been forced to take Papa’s desk because of his misbehavior at the beginning of class. If he hadn’t been acting up, he would have been [unalived] and she would have lived. He carried the guilt of her death until the day he died.Papa’s classroom was on the second floor. There wasn’t any way to get to the room other than the open cavity of the explosion. After the few seconds of initial shock wore off, he and another classmate jumped into action. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164870.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">They were the only two kids in the class who hadn’t been badly injured. They made a tourniquet out of a sock and a shoelace for a girl with a severe injury to her arm and dug out their teacher, who was alive, but badly injured. By then, men were running up underneath the hole, so Papa and the other boy started lowering the injured to them. Then those who could walk, including Papa, climbed down. He ran off to look for his older brother, B, to see if he was OK.As it turned out, B had been supposed to be in Geometry class. However, he and his buddy had snuck out to go fishing. The explosion happened as they were opening the door to head out to the parking lot. The force of the blast sent them tumbling head over foot across the lot. They were both banged up and dazed, but they survived. The rest of their Geometry class was [unalived]. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164871.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I don’t know that there’s a moral in the fact that both my grandfather and his brother survived because they were misbehaving that day. I do know that it weighed very heavily on both of them for he rest of their lives.There’s a lot more to his story about the day and the aftermath (most of it absolutely horrific), but I won’t go into all of it here. A few small tidbits though:- Papa and the boy who helped him rescue the other students from their classroom were both awarded medals and certificates of valor for their actions that day.- Nearly every family in town lost a child - some all of their children. I’m sure you can imagine the extreme toll this took on everyone’s mental health. Papa described New London in the months following the explosion as a “town with no children.” </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164872.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">To help with the healing process, the oil companies actively recruited families with kids to transfer in, so that there was some sense of normalcy when school started again in the fall.- Papa had played French horn in the school band. However, when school started up again, he was asked to switch to trumpet, as the entire trumpet section had been [unalived].A few years later, my grandfather went on to fight in World War II, and he saw some of the worst conflict in the Pacific (including Peleliu and the liberation of Manila). But he said that nothing he saw during the war was ever as bad as what he saw the day of the explosion. I’m always amazed that more people don’t know about it. It was major international news at the time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164874.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Anyone whos familiar with Mary, Queen of Scots most likely knows that she was beheaded, but many people dont know *how* she was beheaded. My APUSH teacher told my class this story and its probably one of the most simultaneously interesting, funniest, and saddest executions in history.The first thing to note was that Mary wore a red dress rather than a white one for a very specific reason: after the execution of a royal or high-class person, commoners would often tear off blood-stained fabric from their clothing solely to flex that they got their hands on the blood of a noble. With red fabric, it would be difficult to see actual blood on the dress. Smart move on Marys end.During the actual execution, it was said that Marys executioner was not very experienced and actually *missed* the initial swing, jamming the axe or whatever weapon they used into the back of her head rather than through her neck. This didnt [take out] her yet, though, and she instead made some sort of medieval olden-time exclamation that can be roughly translated to goddamn! </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164875.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">EDIT: After the executioner was done, he picked up her head by the hair, not knowing it was a wig, and the head fell out and rolled onto the floor (thanks Plug_5 and moiochi for reminding me)After Mary was properly [unalived], her body was left for public viewing, but the audience was surprised to see her red dress start to rustle before allowing Marys small terrier dog to climb out from underneath. Tragically, the dog refused to leave the body and eventually passed away after staying at the same spot for a lengthy amount of time.History buffs, please feel free to make any corrections as I heard this story a while ago and probably made a few errors in my recalling! :)TL;DR: Mary, Queen of Scots avoided crazy memorabilia-savers at her execution with a very intelligent move, got shanked in the head during a failed attempt, the executioner dropped her head onto the floor, and had her dog in her dress with her the entire time</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164876.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky17" id="linky16">30 "Idiots" Who Were Right the Whole Time</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Galileo - he believed the Earth and other planets orbited the Sun, contrary to popular belief that all stars and planets orbited Earth. The Catholic Church called it heresy, and ordered him to turn himself in to the Holy Office to begin a trial for his beliefs.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165582.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Sinead O’Connor - she was vilified for ripping up a photo of the pope to protest child abuse within the Catholic Church. Spoiler alert - the Catholic Church was covering up child abuse.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165564.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Stanislav Petrov. Though we dont see him as crazy, Im sure his crewmates thought he was. He directly disobeyed Soviet military protocols and prevented a nuclear war.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165565.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Rose McGowan was completely ostracized and blacklisted for talking about Weinstein too early.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165566.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. John Yudkin. The single scientist who didnt believe the sugar industrys research that demonized fats. Till his death hes adamant that fats werent the cause of obesity and heart attacks.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165567.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. During the plague in Moscow there was a priest (or something) DIScouraging people kissing the statue of Maria, as to stop the spreading of the virus.

The poor man was burned alive for blasphemy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165568.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Tesla. Edison is still credited with the lightbulb. His last words put it into perspective All these years that I had spent in the service of mankind brought me nothing but insults and humiliation</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165569.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Hemingway talked about the FBI following him prior to his suicide. They thought he was paranoid. Decades later some papers get released, turns out the FBI was following him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165570.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Lisa Bonet. She was vilified for hating Cosby in the 80s. Who’s the villain now?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165571.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. The inventor of dialysis, Dr. Willem Kolff. Although its hard to blame them, haha. He saw people dying of kidney disease and said Hey, what if we take all of the blood out of your body, clean it, and put it back in? (Cleaning your blood is the job of your kidneys, and a dialysis machine is basically an artificial kidney, on the *outside* of your body.) It was a wild idea and he started his work during WWII and had to work with basic materials like orange juice cans, sausage skins, and a washing machine. Many of the first patients died, but they were already going to die painfully. Eventually, he ironed the kinks out and started saving lives.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165572.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Charles Darwin. The religious outcry against evolution was engineered by his academic rivals more than from religious resistance. But even now, after all that politics is centuries dead, there remain people who categorically resist demonstrable fact because of it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165573.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Craig Ferguson having empathy for Britney Spears in his 2007 monologue.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165574.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. There was a wacko looking guy on Oprah who stopped his vanilla presentation to tell the audience that plastic causes cancer, stop using it to store food and water.

Oprah cut to commercial and whisked him off the show.

Dude was right. BPAs were outed that day, but it took another decade for that info to become public knowledge.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165575.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Giordano Bruno was (probably) the first European who proposed the possibility that not only was the universe infinite, but stars were not just points of light in the sky; they could be suns with their own planets, and that some of those planets might even host life.

The Catholic Church had him tried for Heresy and had him burned at the stake and his contemporaries though he was completely insane. He had some kooky ideas, but he was absolutely right about the size of the universe and stars being suns with their own planets.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165577.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Margaret Dunbar. Her four year old son went missing and one day the cops found him and brought him home. Except it wasn’t her son and everyone tried to gaslight her into believing it was. Well she was right and no one knows what happened to the real Bobby Dunbar to this day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165578.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I dont know that guys name but he basically from 1541-1542 travelled accross south america. The first european to do so. While he was on his journey he said he saw millions of people and large cities , with a lot of life in them , where today is the amazon rainforest.After he had finished his journey he had told the stories of those cities and about a hundred years later when explorers visited the place there was nothing , no cities , no people , just jungle. So they thought he had made all that up. But modern technology has shown that there might have accually been a lot of cities there , and that those people died out with smallpox and all cities were covered by the jungle within the course of 50 years. So basically people thought he was crazy and made everything up but in modern times its proven that he was right all along.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165579.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Will Rogers a humorist when he invented the term trickle-down economics as a joke stating that this type of economy would just make the rich richer and the poor poorer.

And then we actually implemented it and used the term trickle-down. And Will Rogers was right.

The rent has gone though the roof and our salaries have stagnated and we cant afford The American Dream anymore.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165580.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Martha Mitchell.. She was like part of the reason why it was discovered that Nixon was involved in Watergate. Her husband was part of the Nixon group so she got some inside details. When she wanted to tell the news about the whole scandal, her husband and Nixon men put her in a hotel and restrained her from having any contact with anyone. She was seen as an insane person her husband and Nixons men even managed to convince the psychiatrists that she was out of her mind.

Actually theres a phenomenon in psychology which was named after her a.k.a the Martha Mitchell Effect</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165581.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Heinrich Schliemann. He 100% believed that ancient Troy had really existed. So he armed himself with a copy of the Iliad, and actually managed to find and excavate the city. Hed told everyone and their sister that Troy was a real place for 40 years before he found it, and everyone thought he was cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Not so much, it turns out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165583.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Remember the government accountant in George W Bush’s presidency who said the war in Afghanistan would cost a billion dollars a month and he was fired? Well, he was right. It was 300 million dollars per day for 20 years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165584.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Dr. Atkins.

When his first book The New Diet Revolution came out, he was mocked and ridiculed for thinking that refined sugars, flour, and starch caused the glycemic index to skyrocket which led to your body storing fat. When he died people thought he died from his own diet.

Keto-acidosis and how you can lose weight by reducing your glycemic index was largely his research.

It was later stolen and copied and called The Zone Diet and The Caveman Diet and The Paleo Diet which were all based on his work.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165585.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. All the people that said the NSA/CIA was spying on us for years.
Thanks to edward Snowden we now know that was true and it was so much so that the NSA had built back doors in pretty much every single electronic device that exsists all the way down to the network switch level on cisco switches and the internet backbone through AT&T network hubs. The fact that there wasnt mass revolt after that information was released kinda blew my mind.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165586.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Eisenhower. Re: The military–industrial complex.

In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165587.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Clair Patterson-he was made out to be crazy by giant oil companies bc he tested ice cores in the Arctic and figured out that the amount of lead in the atmosphere, the water, and our bodies was extremely high and caused by leaded gasoline. He petitioned Congress for years to make it illegal to add lead to gasoline, but the corporations kept getting him shut down because they used lead as an anti-knock agent for internal combustion engines. Ironically, lead was causing everyone else to go crazy because it is shaped like a neurotransmitter and blocks receptors causing insanity, similarly to what mercury does, and many employees of the oil companies had gone mad. After decades of battling the oil companies, he finally got his way and lead was removed from gasoline. Since then, the amount of lead in the atmosphere and I’m living things has decreased dramatically. Clair Patterson… a f**king hero.

He also created the first truly “clean room.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165588.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Boltzman spend his life trying to prove his formula but ended up commiting suicide because none of his collegues believed him. Now, his formula is basically the amen in thermodynamics.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165589.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. MrBeast infiltrated the YouTube market early. Mastered it. Making millions on millions a decade later at age 23. He bet on new media, looked crazy for a while but in the end won big.

I understand to most he’s not a historical figure but as a marketing and digital media expert—he’s a pioneer in my book. He wrote the playbook. Plus there’s a typo in the question haha.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165590.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Lord Kitchener (Horacio Herbert Kitchener) Secretary State of War for the British Army. At the onset of WW1, everyone thought the war would end very quickly, either going one way or the other. Kitchener was one of the few people to envision a long war, and to prepare accordingly, even though the British government actively hampered many of his efforts (even though he was a war hero)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165591.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Mitt Romney and his comment about Russia. I voted against him, but I’ll be damned if he wasn’t right about Russia.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165592.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. Henry A Wallace was Roosevelts running mate and vice president in his 3rd term in office but was dropped from the ticket in the 4th in favor of Truman. Wallace was correct on a lot of issues manifesting in America that are still here today, race, education, and what happens to society unfer unregulated capitalism.

In many ways Wallaces story mirrors the story of every single progressive the democratic party has tried to run in the 20th century. Rhetoric is fine but dont go after corporate greed.

Truman and Wallace could not have been more different. If Wallace had stayed as running mate and vp at the time of FDRs death, its possible to imagine we would be living in a totally different world.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87165593.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
