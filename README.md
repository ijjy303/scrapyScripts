<span style="font-size:4em">2. Sam Rockwell in most of his roles. To me as a kid, he was the most convincing character in The Green Mile, and Tom Hanks was the lead in that movie. -u/weedyscoot

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Stanley Tucci in The Lovely Bones. Took me forever to get that creepy-a** character out of my head whenever I saw him. -u/pikkopots</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87180501.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. John Lithgow in that one season of Dexter. I can’t look at him the same anymore. He creeps me out. -u/yecatsgee</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87180502.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Catherine O’Hara in Schitt’s Creek. I have no idea how she managed to make everything consistently over the top and yet still not turn her character into a despicable self-parody (of a parody of a spoilt millionaire wife). -u/Drusio</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87180510.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge. There are very very few villains that Ive seen in books, movies, or video games that I’ve wanted to personally kill more.

## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">Popular Films the Internet Thinks Are Vastly Overrated</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Encanto. Old matriarch being a selfish jerk? She learned a lesson when it was too late? I feel bad for any dude named Bruno now as they have to listen to that dumb song which means nothing. We dont talk about our brother because he told us things we didnt like. Boohoo! -u/crew88</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87180625.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Precious based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Certified fresh on the Tomatometer, loved by audiences and critics alike. And it was just...poverty torture porn. If it had been based on a true story it would have been incredibly meaningful but when you make that up out of whole cloth it hits different. It felt like a disservice to real people whove had things like this happen to them to just pile it all on one fictional character. -u/matt314159</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87180609.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Pretty Woman. Julia Robert’s as your typical drop-dead-gorgeous streetwalker with no discernible addiction or mental health problems and a heart of gold. And Richard Gere as the stunningly handsome millionaire who’s hard up for a date. Adorable! -u/jenel2583</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87180604.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. For me, it’s The Greatest Showman. Dunno if it was the same in the states but here in the UK everybody and their dog was raving about it saying it was the best musical ever.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. The Notebook. Terrible movie with no actual romance. Five minutes in they expect the audience to believe these two people are in love?? -u/lovebugblues</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87180608.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Into the Wild. Bratty rich kid burns all his sh*t, bums off others across the country, dies in the woods for no good reason.

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “There were, in fact, incidents where undesirables (certain races, disabled people, etc) were sterilized without their consent, going back as far as the 1800s.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “The FBI did want Martin Luther King Jr dead and even went as far as sending him letters trying to bully him into dying by suicide. They may not have put a gun in James Earl Rays hands, but they were happy with the outcome.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180241.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “Not officially confirmed as far as I know, but I think Gary Webb was likely correct about the CIA flooding black neighborhoods with crack in the 1980s to fund thier ops in Nicaragua.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “Remember: it isnt a left vs right issue. It is a top vs bottom issue.Edit: What I mean is it is those in power (top) vs those not in power (bottom). It is completely off balance with the majority of us being on the bottom and subject to those up top. Rules for three, but not for me.Divided we fall. Whatever division we choose to quarrel about doesnt help the top vs bottom problem.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180247.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “MKUltra like someone above said, the FBI seeking out mentally disturbed people to help them plan attacks so they can arrest them right before they carry it out, COINTELPRO, Operation Northwoods and literally everything the CIA dabbles in. I also believe most people dont realize the government has worked directly with media companies since at least WW2 in an effort to sway public opinion in their favor. Add on the theater of left/right politics, 24hr talk shows posing as news and a executive order allowing the US people to openly be bombarded with harmful propaganda.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180249.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

His big secret was that there were supposedly a ton of anonymous, unregulated/illegal trading accounts within their system doing a shit ton of trading volume that all employees were told to ignore and not ask about. Apparently you have to go through a lot of certifications and identity stuff to open a fund of that type, yet these had none of that and were clearly black box slush funds of some kind, maybe worse.

However, the results of that study have been widely criticized by the academic and scientific community as a whole.

## <a href="#linky18" id="linky17">25 Things People Should Know Before Visiting the USA</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. “If you’re in a New York City subway, try not to make too much eye contact or look too long at people around you. Old guy lighting up a crack pipe near the door between cars? Just ignore the smell. Woman near you screaming at the top of her lungs at her silent child? Keep listening to your music. Someone digging through their bag, muttering to themselves, and throwing rose petals on the floor like they’re preparing for a seance? Just keep staring blankly at your phone. Trust me.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180160.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Don’t get into an empty subway car.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180161.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “Raccoons are cute… but from a distance.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180162.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “Dont think the laws are the same everywhere. You can walk with an open alcohol container in Vegas but not many other places. Alcohol laws, pot laws, firearms laws, smoking - lots of very different laws depending on the state and city where you are.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180163.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “If pulled over by the cops, do not exit the vehicle unless they ask you to. The cops might sit in their vehicle for a while, & then they will approach the window & expect you to talk to them while sitting in the car.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180164.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “If you find yourself in Florida, absolutely do not swim in the lakes, ditches, or channels. Any standing body of water can (and does) have alligators in it. Also possibly water moccasins. And maybe even diseases.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180165.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “Don’t assume that the price shown on an item for sale is your price for said item.

<span style="font-size:4em">8. “I live in an area around 4 major rivers and my town has a booming river industry. Someone drowns at least once a month. The current is so strong as soon as your feet hit the water you’re most likely gone. Look at the river, take pictures, stop and look at our murals along our flood walls, but do not go near the river!”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180167.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “Underestimate distances. When I was a tour guide, far too many customers asked how many HOURS the train to New York was [in seattle] and I had to put their jaw back in when I said 5 days.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180168.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “If you go to a department store, Kohls, Target, or even Home Depot, they often try to have people sign up for credit cards. Absolutely don’t do this. Tell your non-English speaking friends this. The short time I worked at target, I often saw people who were clearly just visiting the US get signed up for credit cards. It may not alway work without a social security number, but it is a major time suck for sure.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180171.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “If youre visiting Las Vegas, do not engage with anyone that asks if youll be in town tomorrow night. Theyre trying to rope you into a timeshare presentation and even though theyll offer free show tickets, meal vouchers, and even cash, its not worth it! The tour and short presentation will be way longer (and obnoxiously higher pressure) than youd expect and they know damn well after youve invested a few hours youre not going to leave without the promised reward that they only give you at the very end. These people are most often found at the entrances to malls or casinos at what can be easily mistaken for information booths. Either just say no no matter how long youre actually still going to be there or flat-out ignore them. Also dont accept the cards being handed out by people in brightly colored shirts on the strip unless you want a promo for strippers.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180172.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. “Most places don’t allow alcohol in an open container in public. Have your drinks at the hotel, bar, or restaurant.

<span style="font-size:4em">16. “If you are coming to the Midwest or northeast during winter be prepared and don’t think sunshine means warm weather. It can be deceptively cold:)”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180175.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. “Visiting south west USA? Cali, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico ect, DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE HEAT! All too often people try and hike in 113° and end up needing rescue.

<span style="font-size:4em">22. “Dont count out your money and buy enough stuff that you think its covered. Its not. Theres a hidden sales tax added at the register after they total it up that can be close to 10% more than the marked price.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180181.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. “Do NOT go into the wilderness unprepared. If a trail says 2 miles and 2000 of elevation gain, thats not a nature walk. Do NOT approach wild Animals. Yea, the moose looks big and stupid, but hell kill you. So will the bears, mountain lions, alligators, and snakes.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180183.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. “Dont eat wild mushrooms unless youre an expert. There are deadly species here that look like safe muhrooms in other countries.

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “I remember watching a YouTube interview with a military diver.

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “The sonar we use for deep sea mapping really screws up a number of species especially whales, dolphins and porpoises. Imagine walking around and a tornado alarm decibel-level noise triggers right next to you. We do that every time we use that high-powered sonar and it basically fs up their own sonar abilities causing them to be unable to communicate and navigate.” -Reyltjj</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180137.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “There are perfectly-preserved shipwrecks from ancient Greece preserved at the bottom of the Black Sea. The water is so deep that it becomes anoxic (oxygen free), which preserves organic materials like wood. Shipwrecks are cool, but I find the phenomenon a little disturbing, since there is probably no life down there.” -colorforge</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180138.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “The ocean is blue because all the other pigments are absorbed. So after a certain distance down everything thing becomes a monotone blue color, unless you have some other light source. The freaky part is if a diver gets cut underwater the blood looks black, like ink. All the red has long since been absorbed so there’s no wavelengths left to show you a red color when you bleed.” -Lord_of_the_Canals</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180141.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “I tell new scuba divers this: The ocean doesn’t care about you. It’s not actively trying to kill you. But it will do a lot of things on its own that will absolutely kill you if you’re not prepared and paying attention. I realize this could apply to any natural environment but it feels much more apt when talking about the ocean. One wave that you weren’t prepared for can make your day pretty bad. For the ocean it’s just business as usual.” -deleteduser</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180143.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. “There are parts of the ocean which are dead, no oxygen in the water which means nothing can survive, no fish no plankton nothing at all.

If you need to get rid of a mass grave dont bury them, dump them at sea and the entire body will be eaten. Which will actually be beneficial to the ecosystem as a whole.
