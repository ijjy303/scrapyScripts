## <a href="#linky6" id="linky5">15 Facts That Sound Fake But Are True</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. If you thought the North Pole was cold, meet John Teufel and his colleagues who, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, “squeezed” light to get atoms colder than any known temperature. They lowered the temperature of a small membrane to 360 microkelvins. That’s like 10,000 times colder than the vacuum of space.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175641.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. The gene that lets you have a few extra fingers or toes is a dominant one. By that, we mean that if you get one of these genes from your parents, it will win over the other normal five-fingered gene you got from your other parent. The same happens with the blue eyes vs brown eyes gene, with brown winning.

The only reason why most of the human population does not have extra or even fewer digits as the norm is that the genes for polydactyly (extra digits) and ectrodactyly (missing digits) are very rare.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175629.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The 1988 hit song by Michael Jackson, Smooth Criminal has the lyrics: “Annie, are you okay?” For anyone who is CPR trained, Annie, or rather Resusci Anne is the name of the CPR doll you practice on. One of the first questions the person giving the CPR asks is, “Annie, are you okay”? So Michael Jackson might just have been trained in CPR.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175630.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. A major part of the world speaks English today. But if you hear people from different parts of the world speaking English, you’d think they were all talking in different dialects. Human beings have accents and now it seems goats have them too. So one goat’s bleat may not be the same as another goat’s bleat. Till now, such vocal flexibility has only been found in humans, bats, and dolphins.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175631.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Considering clouds are fluffy and float in the sky, a common assumption is to think that they are light. In fact, the common cumulus cloud, the white fluffy one, often seen on summer days, is pretty heavy. Given the density of the cloud, and the water droplets in it, science says each cumulus cloud weighs around 1.1 million pounds, or 500,000 kg, or even 100 elephants.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175632.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. We know that Harvard University is a storied institute and one that’s older than a whole generation of great-grandparents. Even so, one does not quite come to realize the years of the past unless a comparison is used. Harvard University was founded in 1636, and Galileo Galilei, the father of physics, was still very much around then. Galileo died in 1642.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175633.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. When we think of big cats of the wild, there’s the lion, the tiger, the leopard, the jaguar, and finally, the cheetah. The fastest land animal on earth, watching a cheetah chase down its prey is poetry in motion. But for all its ferocity, a cheetah cannot roar like the other big cats and, in fact, can only meow, hiss, purr, and yelp.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175634.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Female aphids can produce offspring without males being present in a process called parthenogenesis. In fact, most aphids are born pregnant. Embryos are present within the mother’s ovary one after another, in an assembly-line manner. In turn, these developing embryos contain developing embryos of the third generation within them, like nesting dolls.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175635.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. There’s a reason why axolotls look so adorable, and that’s because they are a kind of salamander forever frozen in their juvenile stage in appearance. Even fully-grown axolotls look like other salamanders do in their larval stage. Unlike salamanders, which are amphibians, axolotls remain fully aquatic. They can metamorphose and “grow up” but tend to die soon after.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175636.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Probability, speaking mathematically, makes some events more likely to happen than we’d believe. In a room of 23 people, there’s a 50% chance that 2 people could have the same birthday. This is known as the birthday paradox.

It happens because there are a total of 253 comparisons to make. The first of the 23 people will compare their birthday to 22 others, but the second person will to 21 others, and so on. Here’s the math behind it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175637.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Point Nemo, or “the oceanic pole of inaccessibility,” is the point in the ocean farthest away from land. Its coordinates read: 48°52.6′S 123°23.6′W, and the spot is surrounded by about 1,000 nautical miles (2,688 km) of ocean in every direction.

The closest humans to Point Nemo are not on Earth but in space, given that the International Space Station (ISS) orbits at about 250 miles (402 km) above the surface of Earth.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175638.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. As of 2020, emission control for the maritime fleet has been tightened because ships usually run on the worst and cheapest possible fuel, and end up causing a lot of pollution. A study found out that 16 of the largest ships in the maritime fleet can emit as much sulfur as 800 million cars, approximately.

The nitrogen emissions of the maritime fleet are also probably higher than those of the global car fleet, although cars emit 2-4 times more carbon than the maritime fleet.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175639.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Most fish swallow a gulp of water to allow them to swallow the prey in it. But snowflake moray eels can reportedly come out of the water and chow down on the crabs in the shallows. What allows them to do this is a secondary set of extendable jaws. Known as pharyngeal jaws, they exist inside the throat, behind the primary set of oral jaws. Much like the Xenomorph in the Alien franchise.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175640.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Nowhere in the nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty is it mentioned that he is an egg. Yet every Humpty Dumpty poem shows him to be a cracked egg. In truth, Humpty Dumpty was the name of a cannon used by English Royalists from 1642 to 1649. It sat atop a wall, and an enemy shelling broke the wall. Humpty Dumpty fell, broke, and remained beyond repair.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175642.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Today, for a woman to know if she’s pregnant, she can simply pee on a stick for instant results. The ancient Egyptians had something similar, although not as quick. Women would urinate in 2 different bags, one filled with barley and the other with wheat. If the grain in either bag sprouted afterward, the woman was said to be expecting.

A 1963 study found that this test was fairly accurate, to the tune of 70%. The explanation lies in pregnancy hormones which can promote seed growth.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87175643.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Burned with cigarettes, hands shoved in the garbage disposal, head beaten with a hammer. The incident resulted in a baby she somehow still has. And they’re not even divorced because he won’t sign the divorce papers. I work in a small town gas station, I’m trying to check out customers and she’s reciting a true crime episode to me. The conversation started with mascara recommendations.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Stuck driving a coworker out to a remote gas plant to do a system install. He was kinda f**ked up but assumed it was just socially awkward IT way. Nope. He starts telling me about him and his dad collecting nazi memorabilia and how proud he was of his German grandparents. Trying to make other small talk and he would just trail off answering questions and start singing to himself.

Like if you dont need my products because cleaning your a** with coffee fixes it, why are you here?

<span style="font-size:4em">9. A guy told me during our first shift that his youngest daughter was suicidal, his eldest daughters boyfriend was terribly abusive, and his wife was sleeping with someone at her work.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Had to get my picture taken for a visa so went to a local photography shop that took the pictures and printed them out for you right there. I had been talking to the guy as he worked on other peoples photos and when I finally got my picture taken he started opening up about his family.
Apparently his son was killed 3 years ago in a car accident and he was telling me how much I reminded him of his son (going to school for engineering, 1st generation college student etc.) The son was killed in his senior year so didnt even get to graduate, he even showed me pictures it was heartbreaking.

To make things worse he said he had a degenerative muscular disease and doctors had given him about 2-3 years before hed be bed ridden. He then went on to say his daughter was taking care of him and how she isnt married yet and deserves to live a young persons life and man, it really put into perspective how bad some people have it. I still think about that guy to this day and hope hes doing well. -EA721</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167814.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I made the unfortunate mistake of inviting my old neighbour over when we were having a party. He had like five gins in my kitchen and confessed to an unsolved murder in Nunavut, Canada.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Sat on an Amtrak across from a very sweet older man, who within twenty minutes was telling me about the purpose of his trip to Maryland: to meet his biological father, who he had discovered via 23andMe, to discuss changing his last name, which was the condition of becoming being the sole inheritor of his father’s estate. And that he was feeling a little guilty about that because his three half sisters would be excluded from their father’s will because he “finally had a legacy.” Woof. He disembarked twenty minutes later, and I have thought about it constantly for the following four years. -mom_jean</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167816.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Hitchhiking through New Zealand, I got picked up by a semi driver. Awesome guy, but an hour into the drive started unloading every bit of personal information he could. How he’s cheated on his wife, screwed the company out of money, stolen items… It was like I was a priest in a confession booth. When I asked him why he told me all of that, he said it’s been eating him up inside for years and telling me helped get it off of his chest. He said I had no idea who he or anyone he knew was, so it felt like I was the perfect person to unload on. -birdizthawerd</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167819.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Well this lady who I was working with found out I was slightly acquainted with her fiance and proceeded to tell me all about how his family hates her and is mean to her and all about his substance abuse issues. I dont remember all the details because it was a few years ago but she unloaded on me with every issue of her relationship and Im like Im just here to work. I didnt really even know her fiance. I avoided that lady after that. -beau8888</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167821.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “People on the internet really seem to buy into the idea that elephants find humans cute. The source of this is a tumblr post that claims the same region of the brain thats active when humans see puppies is what lights up when elephants see us. But that requires MRI machines big enough to accommodate elephants, as well as keeping an animal that weighs like 5 tons still whilst its fully conscious. It also means assuming that the brain structures do the same job across species.

<span style="font-size:4em">
If anything, the harsh reality is that wild elephants probably see humans as threats, given that as a species were actively doing our best to kill them. Elephants who live in zoos or sanctuaries may be endeared to their keepers and thus humans in general, however. The good news is that this can probably change if poaching is ever stopped. Elephants whod been raised in the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, for example, have led sick or injured herd-mates back to the sanctuary for treatment.” -ButterflyOfDeath</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174571.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
