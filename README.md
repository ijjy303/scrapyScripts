## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">25 Crazy Urban Legends That Turned Out to Be True</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Serial murderer was picking off indigenous women from the crime ridden area of the city (Downtown Eastside Vancouver) and having their remains disposed of at a pig farm in another suburb - Robert William Willy Pickton - rayrayrayray

 https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugrb3n/serious_what_is_an_urban_legend_in_your_area_that/</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167738.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Not totally true but there was a house in the neighborhood all the kids called the murder house. Usual mean old man stories. If you go on his lawn hell drag you to his basement and murder you. Turns out he was a sex offender with a pretty serious rap and the parents encouraged the story as it made kids stay away without talking about pedophilia. - Niznack</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167739.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The Catman of Greenock - Scottish town 30 mins from Glasgow where I grew up. Kids would all bullshit about a terrifying sounding cryptid - a bearded man with pitch black skin who prowled around at night catching rats and chasing kids who had ventured into some disused underground freight tunnels - part of a coming of age ritual loads of us went through. It was all bravado and made up stories and the only people who I ever heard claim to have seen him were kids that were ages with me and from a part of town I wasnt too local to so it seemed like a big in-joke between some class mates that had spread. In my late teens I met my now wife and eventually met her brother in law who was about 10 years older than us, so approaching 30. I couldnt believe it when he brought up the Catman and swore hed seen him one night when he himself was a teenager and was terrified. I still thought it was all a long con. Then came camera phones and what do you know - plenty of photographs of him taken by intrepid nighttime adventurers who coaxed him out with cartons of chips and cans of Irn Bru, most of which are taken at or around the exact bus depot the brother-in-law saw him all that time ago. (The alleged origin story of Catman as an AWOL Russian sailor are totally unconfirmed. Rumours are he died during lockdown) - Wrathalanche</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167740.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I used to live in a very small town in West Virginia, and there was a local story going around about a giant turkey.
Some hunter swore he saw a turkey that stood 5ft tall, and it had talons that could easily kill a man. So that was the local rumor for a while, theres a giant turkey out there somewhere. Some said he was crazy, others said they saw it too, all kinds of stories going around.
 
Turns out it was an emu. Somebody else saw the thing, and they knew what an emu is.
Some people who raise goats and chickens keep an emu with their herd, emus are territorial and protective of what they perceive to be their group. So they run off predators like foxes and coyotes, and people for that matter.
Most likely it escaped, and nobody claimed it for some reason. - Catshit-Dogfart</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167741.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. That theres a giant man called Purple Aki that approaches people and asks to squeeze their muscles. - DefinitelynotDanger</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167742.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. It wasnt a specific urban legend about my hometown so much as a general urban legend. The legend is derived from late Medieval legends where people journeying through a forest and find a forgotten village the forest grew up around. The only surviving building is a stone church where the last of the villagers gathered before the Black Plague wiped them out 100 years earlier. The travelers find their skeletons still seated around the altar.
In the case of my town, were surrounded by steep high hills. Hikers found a car that ran off the road with a womans skeleton in the drivers seat. She was reported missing in the 1970s but with her car gone and no internet or cell phones, authorities concluded she got simply drove away. Which she kind of did but she ran off the road, crashed in the deep underbrush, and nobody found her til years later.
There are similar stories in other places but mostly cars that crashed into ponds and came out looking like a what a car submerged for 20+ years look like. Her car and her personal effects were mostly intact - basically a 1970s time capsule. - Eric_da_MAJ</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167743.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. The Green Man, Apparently he was a really sweet misunderstood man who was horribly disfigured when he was a kid. He was fond of taking nighttime walks. The pictures of him can give you an idea of why he could be frightening. - Extrasherman</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167744.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. That one of my neighbors was a pedophile. So in my neighborhood the older kids always said the guy was creepy/liked kids. There were several days when he gave everyone ice cream (he drove a tractor trailer for a major ice cream company.) A few years later we got home from school and there were all sorts of FBI/police vehicles outside of his house. Turns out he had been busted in an FBI sting. - TreesOftheEast</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167745.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. That my hometown had its own monk. People were apparently seeing a Buddhist monk around town which would be incredibly unusual where I’m from. It was true though, his name was Paul and he had converted and completely dedicated his life to Buddhism. Very nice man. - _megnn</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167746.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. There was a leader of the local church youth group who also an amateur photographer. Some kid in my class didnt like him and started a rumor that he was a pedophile. It got so big that parents called for an investigation by the school and they found that he actually was sexually abusing his kids. - irrelevant_usernam3</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167747.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Diaper man. Everyone in Elementary school said not to go into the woods because diaper man was back there. A kid even claimed he saw diaper man and we thought he was full of shit. Many years later upon a visit back home I met up with some old friends and we decided to go have a smoke in the woods. We first noticed there were adult diapers tossed into the woods about 5 to 10 feet off the trail. Lots of them. Then, we look up and in the distance. Yep. A full grown adult man in an adult diaper. Diaper man. As soon as he saw us he ran. This was about 20 years ago. I recently visited family again. Went for a jog in those woods. There were adult diapers. Everywhere. And, there again was diaper man. This time as a fit adult on a run, I chased after him. He is a mentally handicapped man who lives in a half way home in the adjacent neighborhood. I guess he has been going into the woods to get rid of his diapers for like 40+ years. - YaGottaBeaDude</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167748.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. There was this giant mansion at the top of a hill near our place that everyone claimed was where the freemasons sent their old, crazy people to die so that their secrets couldnt get out.
Allegedly, there were wild animals all over the place and it was dangerous to try to go there.
Place used to terrify me.
Yeah...it was the masonic retirement home. It has a nature park inside of it. Its in union city, california. - FutureSoldier88</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167749.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Im not Japanese but when they found out that North Korean submarines really had kidnapped kids off the beach, then taken them back North Korea to be raised as spies, it would have blown their minds even more than it did mine: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55651578 - shaggers_jr</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167750.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. As the water dries up, dead bodies will be found in Lake Mead.
[8NewsNow]
(https://www.8newsnow.com/i-team/i-team-body-found-in-barrel-in-lake-mead-may-date-back-to-1980s-more-likely-to-appear-as-water-recedes-las-vegas-police-say/) - stepenyaki</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167751.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. When I was a kid there was a road that ended in a T. but at the intersection. if you drove straight, youd go down a steep gravel/dirt slope there was a small dirt landing and then watter. It was used by locals to launch canoes and small boats into a very large river. Later, The city put up a bended sheet metal railing barrier. One simple rail. It just always was closed except to kids.
in like grade 6 I saw the barrier was blown through and we all talked and all the kids said there was a car in the water. Kidss didnt play there much as someone was dead in the water - everybody knew. Barrier was fixed, nothing came about it for years.
When I was like 19 they were shocked to report that a car and remains were found there. But the big question the media had was how did the car crash into the water when the barrier was unaffected.
Thought to myself...after all this time nobody asked us kids - Wayelder</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167752.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Where I grew up there was a scary old house from either the 50s or 60s across from the church. It was burned, covered in ivy, and didn’t match the giant apartments surrounding it. To access one of the elementary schools and one of the middle schools in the area, you’d have to walk past this scary ass house and you’d see kids avoiding that side of the street simply because they were so scared of the house. Drug addicts wouldn’t even camp there, homeless people wouldn’t take shelter in it even during hurricanes. The rumor was that the house had an entire family get butchered by an insane asylum escapee and that the house has been abandoned since. This was supported by the fact the middle school I mentioned used to be a hospital many claimed was for mental health.
Well, in 2012 that house was bought and eventually torn down to build luxury apartments but no work has ever been done. It’s now an eerie plot of land. So I decided to do some research and, turned out, the schoolyard stories were sort of true. The house was owned by a family who rented out some of the rooms while still living there. The teenaged daughter (Lillian Mojica) was raped and murdered in the basement by one of the tenants. - bzzibee</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167753.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I was driving down a west Virginia back road in the middle of the night when I came around a curve to an injured dog standing in the middle of the road. I slammed on my brakes and missed him by a hair. I got out to find him because he was limping real bad and I was hoping hed have a collar. He vanished into thin air...
Like six months later I was going down the YouTube rabbit hole and watched a video about the most haunted places in west Virginia and they talked about this road that is haunted by a ghost of a limping dog that lures people into the night... SAME. FUCKING. ROAD. They said the route name and I almost threw my laptop across the room.
Im not superstitious... But now? ...Im a little stitious. - Conscious_Camel4830</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167754.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. I guess less so an urban legend and more so a rumor: When I was in 6th grade some kids made a joke that the choir teacher (who taught at both middle and high school) beat his wife, and it spread like wildfire even though everyone knew it wasn’t true. I mean, it couldn’t have possibly been true. He was a scraggly man in his early thirties, with a daughter that is constantly sick due to her chemotherapy, since she was diagnosed with Leukemia when I was in 8th grade. He was always gone every once in awhile with trips to mayo and the cities for her treatments. He was a very nice man that couldn’t possibly hurt a fly.
This all changed however, when just two years ago in my freshman year of high school he got arrested for reportedly assaulting his pregnant wife and seven year old daughter. He was arrested and at his trial he plead guilty, but his case was dropped “due to covid”. He was never fired, and still works as the choir director. To this day I find him a very creepy man, he still talks about his wife and daughter but it’s clear that everyone knows exactly who he is.
At this point our entire high school choir is about five people big, for a school of 2,200 students just because people can’t stand being within 10 feet of him. - glowstick-of-destiny</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167755.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. For decades there were rumors about a “big cave” under a local high school where kids would go down and skip class and smoke pot. Well in 2011 they discovered water run off caverns under that same school so the kids weren’t lying. Nothing weird really bc my state is known for having a lot of caves but yeah kinda ruined everyone hangout spot lmao. - mellowpotions</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167756.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. There were rumors of a inbred mutant enclave in the woods north of nyc in the Hudson valley that dare takers would take a drive up to. The mutant part isn’t real and the inbred part is questionable but Oniontown is very much real and documented. - Tinaszombie</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167757.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. There used to be a massive urban legend about a panther living in the mountains near where I live even though no big cats are native to my country and always got attributed to blurry photos etc. Turns out a guy had an illegal collection of exotic animals and released them when he got wind that authorities were going to do an inspection of his property. - hopelesseelsfan</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167758.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. in my home town, there was an old bridge built in the 20s. It was smallish, just going over a small stream between where two small towns meet. There was a rumor that there was a treasure dropped into the cement when it was wet. There was also a rumor several builders fell into the cement and died during the construction. There was also a rumor that a dead body was thrown into it by the mob.
They demolished the bridge a few years back, finding two skeletons and a briefcase of money (I think a few thousand dollars). If I remember correctly, the two skeletons were from workers of the bridge (something that was reported and archived in a newspaper back in the 1920s and anyone could have actually researched if they wanted to). I have no idea how the briefcase of money got in there, and I dont think anyone ever came up with an answer for it. - AquanautOrange</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167759.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. My friend lived in central New Jersey and used to tell us about the ‘prison farm’ where inmates were used for hard labor and the cows had plexiglass windows bolted to their sides so you could see them digest their food.Turns out, it’s all true - Macronaut</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167760.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. The rumour was There was a local homless/ mentally unwell person, that was actually quite rich and owned a mansion. Turns out there was some truth to that. Once his issues became apparent his mother set out with a plan and largely worked herself to death to buy a house and set up a bunch of trusts and carers for him and basically train him to look after himself. Thing is his mother apparently never really considered what he would actually do all day never set him up with a role or job. He wore scruffy clothes because he liked those clothes, and was always hanging around the market Square because the library was there and the market traders were always friendly and chatty. We learned all this when one of my friends was hired on as a carer, she got him a role at the library and got him a small part time job at a charity shop both of which he seemed to deeply enjoy. - Lostboxoangst</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167761.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Often, burnt bodies are found in the same stance, known as the “Boxer Pose” due to muscles contracting from heat. It’s an incredibly disturbing looking thing, I first heard about it from my Grandfather that fought in Burma. During the war he was present at a Burmese funeral in which the cadaver was burnt on a pyre. Just as the flames began to singe the corpse, it sat up straight. The Burmese, of course, got a good laugh out of the British soldiers collectively shitting themselves, as contractions due to heat during cremation is apparently rather common. Doesn’t make it any less creepy. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167858.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

If memory serves from when I first read this and listened to the audio recordings, it feels like a massive, massive heart attack.

Pelicans will go into other birds nests, shove the parents out of the nest. They will then swallow babies whole, fly back to their own nests, and regurgitate the still half alive, partially digested babies, to their own babies for them to consume. Some pelicans are literally raised on the partially digested, living flesh of other baby birds. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167863.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

They could not get him out, but almost did, one of the rescuers made eye contact with him apparently but then their pulley system broke and he fell further down. Unfortunately he ended up dying of cardiac arrest from being upside-down for so long and they couldn’t get him out / never retrieved the body because it was too dangerous for rescuers. Truly so disturbing, I’ve thought about it probably once a week since I found out about it a few months ago.

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">24 Pieces of Advice That Sound Crazy but Aren’t</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Do you understand, that if you try to endlessly stack bricks, no matter how perfect you do it, they will fall over? My boss told me this after I burned out. Just says that no matter how well you plan your work, too much is too much. -u/IsabellaCps</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168611.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Make them tell you no. Its great when youre not sure if you should apply for a job, go for a promotion or a raise, or do something youre afraid of. Dont be so worried about getting told no or failing, youll surprise yourself. -u/Marnett05</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168612.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “If you sit quietly while everyone else f*cks up, you’re going to win big!” -John Oliver. I’ve gotten multiple jobs and school opportunities by just doing my work and not being a loud moron. -u/Redqueenhypo</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168613.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. From my 7-year-old daughter…I still laugh about it today. If you’re ever in an awkward situation with someone or need to just go away, you could always pretend to choke on something. I don’t know where this came from but it’s funny AND it works. You just run away to get a glass of water. -u/Typical-me-</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168614.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If you need to remember something, write it 3x or say it out loud 3x. Always weird when you repeat something verbally 3x, especially names. -u/RainingRetro</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168615.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. If looking for something in a low light environment, try to use your peripheral vision. I read about it in an old WWII manual about aerial combat at night. It has something to do with how eyes work. It has helped me many times over the years. For finding stuff in a darkened room, or outside in a field at night, not aerial combat. -u/BMLortz</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168616.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. No one thinks about you as much as you do. Meaning we’re all worried about people thinking about the tiniest embarrassing things we do, when no one really cares. It gave me freedom to take on more challenges and not worry about failure. -u/derpitaway</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168629.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Dont give excuses unless they ask for it. I.E. if you are late for work, just say that you are late. Not why you are late. -u/Gurkeprinsen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168617.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Time will pass either way—if you want to work to get better at something, accomplish a long-term goal, or change careers or credentials, don’t look at the 2-5 years and think you’ll be too old. If you’re 24 and want to go to college, you’ll be 28 in four years with or without a degree regardless of what you do in that time. -u/Mild-Intrigue</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168618.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Anger and remorse are shadow companions, with remorse always a step behind. I took control over my temper issues by reminding myself of this one-liner. Hope this works for you, too! -u/Cogito747</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168619.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. It’s only embarrassing if you’re embarrassed. The older I get, the more I understand this one. -u/PB-JAM</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168620.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Fail quickly, as in: If your plan may not succeed, better to find out next week than next year. Helped me quit a suffocating job and dig into my own business 10/10. -u/NNakedLunchDate</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168621.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. If you cant fight the fear, do it scared. Got me through a lot of anxiety. -u/ChasingAlnilam</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168622.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. My mother always said Go back to basics whenever I was struggling mentally. I disregarded it for years but now I live by it. I only utilize this way of living during desperate survival times, but its amazing advice. -u/Staceystallion1</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168623.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Don’t beat yourself up forever. Beat yourself up once then move on. Mr. Homer Simpson. -u/Amy-Paradise</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168624.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. If you want to buy something, wait 24 hours and if you still want to buy it afterwards then buy it. This has really cut my impulse buying down and has made saving money extremely easy. -u/ThaMuffMango</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168625.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. People don’t always remember what you say but how you make them feel. -u/THGilmore</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168626.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. When writing an e-mail, leave the recipient field until last. -u/Ocsttiac</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168627.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Stressed, upset, panic attack, ennui? Put an ice cube in your hand. Move it around your hand until it slowly melts. It takes about 5 minutes. Primary Effect: the cold on your skin grabs your brains attention. You stop thinking about what was stressing you out and feel present in the moment. Secondary Effect: the cold cools your blood, which goes into your heart and slows down the beating.

As your heartbeat slows to maintain your body heat, your lungs breathe more slowly as well. It forces you to breathe, which calms you down. After 5 minutes of this, you will feel much calmer, if slightly drippy. -u/LeskoLesko</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168631.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

Its meant to redirect negative self admonishment into a drive to grow and learn. And apparently, its sinking in because she will say something like Ugh, I cant make it up this hill! while were out bike riding and then catch me looking at her, give a big eye roll and go ...yet! in the exact tone you think a teenage girl would use. Then she ends up sometimes just rage-succeeding to prove the point, its great. Shes going to be at least 3 times better than me, low as that bar may be. -u/Zambeeni</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168634.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky10" id="linky9">19 Ex-Thieves Teach You How to Avoid Getting Robbed</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I would check out a house several times over two days. If there was no sign of movement — no lights coming on or off, no curtains moved, newspapers left on the driveway — I was interested.

Is the house in a nice neighborhood? Is it well kept? If so I figured they had nice stuff.

Next question: Is there an easy escape route? Woods in the backyard were excellent.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166948.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. A recent study showed that burglars come back to the same houses quite often. They do this because of a number of motives.

1: They want to take things they, for some reason, couldn’t take the first time.

2: They’re kinda familiar with the house.

3: It’s guaranteed that the people they robbed replaced the stuff they stole the first time, often these replacements are of better quality than the original.

So after you get raided take good security measures.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166949.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Don’t leave empty boxes from high-end electronics on the curb outside your house. People tend to do this right after the holidays. Put that shit in your car and throw it out somewhere else. Any burglar casing your neighborhood will see that shit and know without even coming near your house and looking suspicious that you just got a bunch of valuable stuff just ready to be taken.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166950.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Let me give you the low-down on dogs: they aren’t protection or security.

A dog can be easily tamed usually. Act friendly, give it a few rubs, and they’ll happily follow you around. If that doesn’t work, after my first run-in with an annoying dog (a small, yappy dog), I started carrying rawhide sticks with me. That stopped them very fast.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166951.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I’m not a burglar, but I worked for the largest security company in this country for half a decade.

Burglar alarms do not deter burglars. They just alert you that you have been burglarized. Most of the time the police will take very little action in response due to the fact that 98% of burglar alarm activation constitutes false alarms.

The sign that comes with the alarm though? That thing is worth more than the alarm as far as deterring burglars.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166947.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Double pane windows. Bitch to smash with anything short of a sledgehammer.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166952.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Those family car stickers certainly tell me how easy a home invasion will be.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166953.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. You’d be surprised how often people get robbed by people they know or people connected to people they know.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166954.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. When I was young and dumb I would boost rims off cars, cause you could make quick money and it was less than a felony. The number one deterrent hands down……lights. If a place is lit up like a Christmas tree on the outside of a house you stay clear cause it means anyone can see you and see you clearly</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166955.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Even if your house is well-locked, if your shed isn’t, I likely have access to a plethora of tools I can use to gain access. Don’t help the burglar. Lock your shed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166956.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I use to do door-to-door sales for ADT… people would let me in the house and just tell me where all the important stuff was before even verifying I was legit….. don’t do that.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166957.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I stuck with commercial burglary, residential burglary carried a risk of getting hit with a home invasion charge which increases your sentence if convicted. It helps to hit the places that hire felons (fast food joints, video stores, etc.) because the cops are gonna waste a lot of time looking into the staff members who have a criminal history. The closer they’re looking at them, the better off I am.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166958.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. A good burglar will rob you when it’s raining. The rain masks sound when you’re breaking into a garage. I had my garage broken in during torrential rain, all tools stolen, didn’t hear a thing and neither did my dog that sleeps outside.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166959.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Had my house burglarized by a so-called friend. He missed by far the most valuable thing. it’s just a safe sitting on the laundry room floor. He missed it because I’m a scumbag and had it covered with a mountain of dirty clothes and towels. So not being tidy saved me upwards of 35k.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166960.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Fake rocks are a dead giveaway. Sock drawers are cliché. If you have a small safe that’s not bolted down, we are taking that thing. We all have a ‘safe guy.’ Our goal is to get in and out pretty quickly. If you hide something in a random box all the way up in your attic, it’s probably safe.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166961.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. For the college kids that might read this, don’t keep your textbooks in your car. On the day of my finals, I had about 6 textbooks I was gonna sell after my finals, I left the books in my car while I took my tests. Came back to find someone broke my window out to steal the textbooks. Cop told me that it’s very common and unlikely they will catch the guy, so I was out ~$700, which was huge as a college student.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166962.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I’ve seen people make false outlets for hiding valuables like cash and jewelry.

## <a href="#linky13" id="linky12">20 Ground Rules for Boob-Watching from the Women Folk Themselves</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. If it’s a quick glance, it’s fine. That’s normal and feels mostly involuntary on behalf of the person looking. I notice but it doesn’t bother me. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121137/87169274/etiquette-02.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> If they stare at my boobs while other people are talking—or worse, while I’m talking—that makes me uncomfortable. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/011159/87169320/etiquette-06.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> Fortunately, I’ve experienced glancing a lot more frequently than staring. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013434/87169369/etiquette-13.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. When women wear graphic t shirts with writing on their chest I’m always hesitant to read it because I don’t want to look like a jackass. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013504/87169371/etiquette-12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I can tell when someone is reading my shirt versus just staring at my boobs. I don’t mind people stopping and taking a good look at the text, I know it’s hard to read, I’ll even turn and fully face them so they can read it properly. I don’t mind this at all, if I’m going to slap a message on my tits I’m doing it cause I want people to read the message. No biggie! </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121114/87169272/etiquette-03.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> In fact asking a woman “what does your shirt say” is a really good way to break the ice. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/015227/87169386/etiquette-17.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> I’ve seen multiple people mention feeling uncomfortable reading name tags. It’s always okay to read name tags! They’re literally there to be read. I’ve seen some women put their name tags on their upper sleeve if they felt uncomfortable with drawing attention to their left tit so in that instance you’ll know a woman doesn’t want you staring at her chest. If you’re really uncomfortable with reading a name tag that’s okay, just introduce yourself and then ask their name. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121201/87169276/etiquette-05.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
