<span style="font-size:4em">1. The Earths crust is so thin, that it can be compared to the skin of an apple, with a thickness-to-diameter ratio of about .4%.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143256.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. In 2019, a doghouse in Costa Rica was struck by a meteorite. Shockingly, its actually incredibly rare for an object to actually be hit by a meteorite, and as a result, the doghouse became one of the most valuable pieces at a space-themed auction. The doghouse ended up selling for $44,000, while a piece of the meteorite itself went for $21,000. And in case you were wondering, the house belonged to a pup named Roky, who was in the house when the meteor struck, but was luckily unharmed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143247.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. During the trial a year later, Dominos claimed that not a single person ordered a pizza for the five minutes it took to read the final verdict. More than 150 million people tuned into the final moments of the trial.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143249.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Point Nemo is the location in the ocean that is farthest from land, coming in at about 2,688 kilometers or 1,450 miles from Ducie Island, which is the nearest land. The location was named after a submarine sailor from Jules Vernes classic novel, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Point Nemo is known as the space junk graveyard because its the safest place for space debris to fall. In 2030, the International Space Station will crash into the ocean at Point Nemo. More than 263 pieces of debris have fallen at Point Nemo since 1971.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143250.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Ever wondered why some countries drive on the left side of the road? It dates all the way back to the Roman Empire. Because most people are right-handed, it made it easier to stab strangers who passed them on the right side.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143251.gif" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. In the 1990s, Marlon Brando, famous for his role in The Godfather, used to spend his days in AOL chatrooms, where he would get into political arguments with strangers. Brandos account was frequently suspended after telling people to fuck off when they didnt agree with him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143252.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Marcel Petiot was a French doctor who was suspected of killing over 60 people. Petiot served in World War I, but was discharged after he injured his own foot with a grenade. After the war, Petiot turned to medicine, and completed an accelerated medical program designed for war veterans. He moved to Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, a commune in Northern France. Petiot quickly gained a reputation of dubious practices after performing illegal abortions and supplying patients with narcotics, which he was also suspected to be abusing himself. Despite this, Petiot became mayor of Yonne, but was soon accused of theft.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143253.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. After this accusation, Petiot fled to Paris, where he opened a new medical practice. He used fake credentials to attract patients and in 1936, was appointed médecin détat-civil, which meant he was able to write death certificates. During World War II, he provided people fake disability certificates so they could avoid having to serve. Petiot also created a fake escape route under the name Dr. Eugène. He told people he could get them out of France, and lured Jewish people and Resistance fighters to a secret passageway. Petiot told them they needed a certain vaccine before escaping, and then injected them with cyanide and burned their bodies in the basement of his house after stealing their belongings.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143254.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. French authorities discovered this plot in 1943 after several of Petiots accomplices ratted him out. Much to the authorities dismay, they couldnt find Petiot anywhere. Turns out, he had adopted a new identity, and was now acting as Henri Valeri. As Valeri, he joined the French Forces Of The Interior and quickly moved up the ranks to become captain. One of his main duties? Find Marcel Petiot. He was recognized at a train station and captured several months later. Petiot went on trial in 1946, where he admitted to killing 63 enemies. The media began calling him Dr. Satan. He was executed by guillotine two months after the trial.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143255.gif" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Vincent Van Gogh didnt begin his painting career until his late twenties, and enrolled in art school in 1880 at age 27. Despite his late start, he created over 2,100 works of art.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143257.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Those 2,100 works of art included over 850 oil paintings and over 1,300 watercolors and sketches. Most of his paintings are from the last two years of his life. Van Gogh died by suicide in 1890.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143258.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Finches, sparrows, and other species of birds who live in cities will often line their nests with cigarette butts from the streets. Why? The nicotine smells deter predators and parasites. While this tactic keeps out pests, researchers are investigating the potential consequences of this practice. Many compounds in cigarette butts are known carcinogens, while others are pesticides.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143259.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. In the 1930s, Louis Rothschild, the Jewish heir to the Austrian branch of the Rothschild banking dynasty, was worth about 2 billion shillings, or $10 billion in todays money. During World War II, Rothschild refused to leave Austria, which prompted the Nazis to capture him, believing they could leverage the businessmans life to gain access to his billions. After being held for 14 months, the Rothschild family gave the Nazis $21 million, which equals about $400 million in todays money in exchange for the safe return of Rothschild. It was the largest ransom for a single individual in history.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143260.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. George Carlin, the comedian who was also the narrator for the first several seasons of Thomas The Tank Engine, was nervous about performing his lines without an audience. Someone suggested a child be brought to the booth where he was recording, so that Carlin could perform to the child. While this request was denied, a producer suggested bringing along a teddy bear. For the next four seasons, Carlin spoke all of his lines to the stuffed animal.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143262.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. When developing the game cartridges for the Nintendo Switch, the game company decided to coat them in a foul-tasting film to dissuade babies and animals from putting them in their mouths. They used Denatonium Benzoate, which is known as the most bitter chemical compound. The coating is non-toxic, and designed to be so gross that anyone who puts it in their mouth will want to immediately spit it back out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143263.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Palm trees actually arent trees — theyre just large plants, like bamboo.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143264.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. While were all now familiar with the long process of Supreme Court justice hearings, it used to be a much simpler affair. In fact, before 1916, Supreme Court justice nominees were simply voted on by the Senate. The hearing process began when President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis, a successful lawyer who served as one of Wilsons aides, to the court. Brandeis was Jewish, and several members of the Senate were opposed to the nomination of a Jewish man. It took four months of hearings before Brandeis nomination was confirmed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143265.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. At least nine fatal military flights were caused by the pilot having to pee during the flight. Military pilots used to have to unzip their flight suits and pee into a bag called a piddle pad. This was especially difficult for women, who often would refrain from drinking water before a flight, even though dehydration can dramatically affect vision and reaction time. As a result, the US Air Force is developing a new technology that involves a pad for women, and a cup for men attached to a tube through a special pair of underwear, which will pull their pee through the tube to a collection bag.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143266.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. There was once a time when Burger King wasnt quite fast food. From 1992 to 1994, the chain used to offer table service, with waiters delivering patrons their food to promote their new BK Dinner Baskets. They even brought popcorn to every table as an appetizer. The initiative only lasted for two years, and was quietly discontinued.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143267.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. After the Titanic sunk in 1912, over 118,000 people claimed that they were supposed to be on the ship, but missed the inaugural voyage for various reasons. “Up to the present time the count shows that just 118,337 people escaped death because they missed the Titanic or changed their minds a moment before sailing time,” an Ohio newspaper wrote weeks after the tragedy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143268.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. After leaving office, President Ulysses S. Grant was facing financial failure after a series of bad investments and lavish living. His son had started his own investment firm with a friend named Ferdinand Ward. Grant agreed to let Ward handle his money. What Grant and his son didnt know was that Ward was running a large Ponzi scheme, and was pocketing Grants money for years. In poor health and close to bankruptcy, Grant decided he would sell his memoirs. He began writing, but was diagnosed with cancer while working on the project.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143269.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Grant was desperate to finish writing before his death so that his family wouldnt face poverty. He signed a contract stating he would receive 10% of the profits, a deal that was standard for the time. Mark Twain, who was one of Grants close friends, heard about the deal and thought it was appalling that a former president on the verge of death wasnt given a larger deal. Twain stepped in and offered Grant a new contract, complete with a large advance payment, living expenses, and 70% of the books profits. Grant reluctantly accepted, and finished the book in July 1885. He died a week later, but his wife Julia earned nearly $11 million (in todays money) thanks to Twains deal. Talk about a good friend!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143270.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. In November 2008, a factory worker named Ronald Ball allegedly found a dead mouse in his can of Mountain Dew.

## <a href="#linky11" id="linky10">24 Saddest Encounters With Celebrities</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. My brother met Gene Simmons back stage at a show he was playing in. Gene complimented my brother highly on his guitar playing but then said too bad youll never make it and just walked away.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144451.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I work for an airline, so I see some celebs from time to time. One time Tom Cruise cussed me out because I wouldnt violate federal law and bring his checked bags to him planeside. Made him go to baggage claim like everyone else.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144455.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Went and saw Steve-O do his stand up tour. After his show, he said he would meet everybody there. We waited in line, and he was being super nice, laughing and taking pictures with everyone. Right before we got to the stage some fat, redneck asshole told him that he was funnier back when he was on drugs. It killed his whole vibe. When we got to him he just took a picture with us and said thanks for coming, but he was clearly in a bad mood. I dont blame him at all, he was still extremely nice, but he was clearly irritated. It was cool that he still met us and took a picture with us though. Seemed like a really cool dude.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144454.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Organized a good sized comic con, so Ive worked with quite a few. But the saddest was really subtle:

Peter Mayhew (chewbacca), was in the green room for lunch on the 2nd day. He looks very tired and is almost totally wheelchair bound because of his terrible joint problems. Im sitting across from him while we eat and his assistant asks if his hand is feeling alright to sign more autographs (terrible arthritis).

He closes his eyes and nods his head and whispers out how much longer will this go today? To which his assistant delicately replies just 5 more hours.

And he whimpers a little and sheds a few tears as they wheel him away from the table and back out to the fans.

The saddest part is that hes the nicest guy and never denies a fan while hes at the con and always smiles even though hes in loads of physical pain.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144444.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I used to go to a small gym. The owners were laid back and had their cats roam around all the time. It was never an issue and people who went regularly would pet them in between sets. My husband and I go to the gym one day. Were the only ones there aside from a trainer in the corner with someone. My husband (a very observant man) tells me to go do some kettle bell swings. I thought it was weird but headed over to the kettle bell section. There is the trainer with Ben Affleck (training for Batman). I didnt want to disturb him, so I completely ignored him. Except its a small gym. So Im working out on the bench next to nice guy Ben, and I can feel him trying to acknowledge me. Suddenly I notice one of the cats starts to pee in the corner next to Ben. I shout NO! to stop the cat, and scoop him up. Ben turns to me and says Hey, is that your cat? Clearly trying to start conversation. I look at him and awkwardly say Its not my cat and walk away. I had an opportunity to talk to Batman and instead became the crazy cat lady. My husband was watching from afar, dying laughing. Now whenever I do something awkward my husband will scream Its not my cat!!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144446.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I became interested in evolution and physical anthropology in high school after exploring the topic in books and discovered Richard Dawkins. I was in the process of reading another of his recent books when I found out he was doing a signing in the city. So I went to his talk and waiting in line to get an autograph.

All through the Q&A session, people had great complex questions for him about his theories and ideas on evolution or certain species. I thought I would be clever and ask a simple and fun question. So in the cover of the book, I wrote, What is your favorite animal? I expected this to be refreshing when he went to sign my book.

I got to the front and as he opened my book to sign it, he was a little thrown off. He gave me a look like I was mentally impaired and just signed his name.

I was crushed and felt really embarrassed that my recent idol thought I was stupid. I wandered off through the racks of books and found a small group of 5 people huddled around one man speaking.

I was curious and still trying to forget my last encounter, so I listened to this energetic man speak about the universe to this impromptu gathering. He was very knowledgeable and interactive. When I got a chance I asked him the same question, Whats your favorite animal? He was very happy with the question and went on a long explanation of why the wolf was his favorite and when he first encountered one in Yellowstone.

I learned later that man was Neil Degrasse Tyson. What a day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144447.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Been waiting for a moment to tell this one. When I worked at a restaurant in Florida a few years ago Muhammad Ali and his family came in to eat. Me being a fanboy and knowing who Ali was kept staring from a distance, and eventually ran next-door to Books A Million to buy his biography King of the World and have him sign it.

As he was leaving I stood and held the door open for them.

His wife was helping him out of the door. He was looking at the ground. No speaking. Slow walking. Shaking from the Parkinsons.

He got to the car and his wife was helping him in. I asked her if I could meet him and have him take a photo and an autograph.

She was delighted and said sure! Cassius, this young man would like to meet you she said. I held out my hand and shook the hand of the greatest Boxer to ever live. The hand that knocked out Fraiser. That mighty right hook.

I immediately started crying. (And tearing up right now). She said dont cry, its okay! I had to explain that its surreal to meet the famous Ali.

She handed him the book and the sharpie and said Cassius he wants your autograph and she opened the book for him and put the pen in his hand. He took at least (no joke) 2 full minutes to sign his name. And it was at that point that it killed me. This was Cassius Clay. Muhammad Ali. The most charismatic, float like a butterfly sting like a bee, man in boxing history. And he was such a shell of his former self because of the Parkinsons. It was so heartbreaking. It really was.

She then took a photo of us together and I thanked him, and her and went on my way.

But god damn that will be the saddest moment meeting a celebrity I think Ill have face.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144448.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I got c*ckblocked by Brad Pitt.

I was an extra in World War Z and I met this girl there and we were talking and all was great until one time Brad Pitt walks by.

Was very friendly to her... totally blanked me.

His stunt double was a cool dude though.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144449.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Betty White. It was right after the Golden Girls (and Golden Palace) had ended. Her career was not in the best place at the time. I was at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles and saw a poster promoting Betty White signing her latest book about how much she loves animals. I liked the Golden Girls so I thought I would swing by the bookstore to take a gander at Betty White. It was so sad. Ill always remember she was sitting alone at a big table with a stack of books in front of her. People were in the bookstore shopping but no one was buying her book or really acknowledging her. She just sat there, pen in hand, waiting. She would occasionally wipe off some imaginary dust to look busy. Im getting the chills just remembering it. Of course, I was such a self-involved college kid that I just stared at her from far away. I should have just gone up and talked to her.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144450.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I was drunk at a friends bachelor party in vegas in 95. We are walking through the casino, and I see this glorious man with what can only be described as the aura of a movie star around him. I immediately recognize him as Sammy Davis Jr. I run up and say Sammy can I get an autograph?! and he just turns around like he didnt hear me and starts walking. Thinking he couldnt hear me I kind of yell Sammy Davis Jr!. He turns around, looks right at me, and says Youre a real asshole.

I was pretty oblivious and had no idea why Sammy Davis Jr. was treating me like I had slapped his little sisters ass. For a few years after that every time his name came up I told people how big of a jerk Sammy David Jr. was. Fast forward to a few years later and Im watching the movie Renaissance Man with Danny Devito and Im like wait I didnt know Sammy David Jr was in this movie ....which caused me to imdb it ...and it all finally clicked.

I had called Gregory Hines Sammy Davis Jr. to his face 5 years after Sammy died. It was probably the most delayed embarrassment Ive ever felt in my life.

tldr: I have no idea what Sammy Davis jr. looks like.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144452.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I met George R. R. Martin at the Blaze Pizza in Evanston a couple of months back when he was in town to accept an award from Northwestern University. At the time, I was listening to the audiobook of A Clash of Kings, and he very excitedly told me, Youve got a ways to go to catch up! When I told him that Ive already read what hes published three times, and am listening to the audiobook as a new way to experience the story, he just kind of ... deflated. He let out a big sigh, and just said, Yeah, I need to finish the next book. People wont stop bothering me about it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144453.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. After Katrina, my now-wife and her then-boyfriend were in Whole Foods in New Orleans, shopping. There was a guy there who looked like Laurence Fishburne, and the boyfriend turns my wife and says, loudly, Damn! Laurence Fishburne got fat!

The man turns around slowly and just stands there, looking at them, forlorn. It was Laurence Fishburne.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144456.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Saw Robin Williams in a bar downtown Toronto. he was so hammered and non coherent. My girlfriend and I tried to speak to him but only slurs and spit bubbles came out of his mouth, he fell on the dance floor twice and looked ready to pass out. To see My childhood hero in such a mess made me really sad. Some girl at the bar was hitting on him then after my gf asked him for a picture.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144457.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. I was working as a concierge at a high end resort in Park City, Utah. Justin Timberlake was staying with us for Sundance, and one of his entourage called the front desk and let us know their internet was being flaky. I was the go-to tech guy, so I ran up to his room and restarted the router for them, and I was hero of the night to everyone in the room. Literally, high fives and chest bumps. As I was riding the elevator down, I heard Timberlake in the garage (great acoustics) BELTING out one of his songs as he was waiting on the lift. The door opened, and we were standing face to face, and I said I dig your sound, man. He looked at me dismissively and said You should. I get paid for it. and walked past me like a schoolyard bully, complete with shoulder bump.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144458.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Met Vince Vaughn in a bar in Hollywood. He was with his entourage or whatever, and had quite a few drinks. He hit on a (girl) friend of mine, and I was amazed to see her totally blow him off. Not that she should have gone for it, but it was pretty incredible to see a multi-millionaire movie star get rejected by an accountant.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144459.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. My saddest celebrity encounter was also my greatest. When I was in college I was an extra in a few scenes of We Were Soldiers, a Vietnam movie with Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott. While I was waiting for a bus to take me back to wardrobe one of the casting guys came up and picked me out of the crowd and asked me if I wanted to be in another scene with Sam Elliott. Of course I was ecstatic. I sat in this van waiting for Sam to come out and it was going to drive us to the scene.

Finally he comes out looking all pissed off and sits in the front seat. Against my better judgement I said something to the effect of, Mr Elliott Im a huge fan of yours and its an honor to be in a scene with you. He snaps back: Shut the f*ck up kid. Needless to say when Sam Elliott tells you to STFU, you do it. So thats the sad part, though getting cussed out by a guy who typically plays the badass in movies was cool in some way.

We film the scene which is a short scene where he walks by Chris Klein and cusses at him about something. We film it over and over and Im just some soldier walking by in the background. Occasionally between takes Sam would look over at me and scowl. After its done we get back in the van to head back and Sam is again in the van. He turns around and says, Sorry about earlier kid, I just didnt want to f*ck up my mood for the scene. I appreciate the compliment. Suddenly it dawned on me that when he cussed at me he was trying to stay in character for the upcoming scene. Pretty cool experience.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144445.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Rachel Weisz. I never let on that I knew who she was and just chatted happily with her as the conversation dwindled and she became more sullen and withdrawn. Finally she snapped at me about something and I immediately sat back and went silent. A couple minutes after, she got up to use the restroom and her nanny leaned over and said simply and quietly, She gets upset if you dont acknowledge who she is.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144460.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Well, I once wanted to get Daryl Hannahs autograph for my friend who had been crushing on her since FOREVER. I couldnt summon up my courage to approach her directly, so I just asked the dude sitting next to her. He put me off very politely.

I went back to my friends emptyhanded and was complimentary of Mr. Nobodys manners. They told me Id just asked JFK Jr for Daryls autograph.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144461.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. My mom found Paris Hilton incognito in an airport, came to find me, brought me to a tiny lady in a hoodie and big sunglasses in the middle of the airport, goes hi are you Paris Hilton? Then pushed me in front of her and said here, say hi to my son! Like I was a weird birthday gift or something.

She said sup. I said sup then she did this weird little laugh. Then my mom goes okay bye!

That was my sad and awkward meeting with Paris Hilton in an airport.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144462.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. DMX very graciously held a door open for me recently. It was a nice encounter until I saw in the news the next day that he had been found unconscious in the parking lot later that evening.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144463.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Met Samuel L. Jackson at a celebrity golf pro am. Shook his hand after I found his ball in the rough and asked him to sign my wallet the one that says BAD MOTHER F*CKER Id bought off eBay since I love Pulp Fiction so much. Had the marker and all. He just said No chance. That feeling of disappointment will be forever with me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144464.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. I was at a cheese shop in the West Village (I realize how douchey this sounds) when I noticed James Spader was at the counter. I was in the middle of a massive Boston Legal binge at the time and absolutely adored his work. So I went to the counter and started looking at the cheese (this is casual, its a cheese shop for f*cks sake). He was sampling cheeses and I just looked at this man whose work I so admired and respected and said hows the Gouda? Apparently its delicious. Stupid. Stupid.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144465.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Eminem. I just think its F*CKED UP he dont answer fans If he didnt wanna talk to me outside his concert he didnt have to, but he coulda signed an autograph for Matthew Thats my little brother man, hes only six years old We waited in the blistering cold for him, four hours and he just said, No.

Gold virginity popped cheers!!!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144466.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Aziz Ansari hit on me years ago and I was too starstruck to remember how to talk.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87144467.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I was banned for life from attending Late Night with David Letterman because I cancelled my reservation. I guess it was hard to find people for the audience in freaking New York City? The intern (I assume) who I talked to was very serious: “You should know if you cancel you will never be allowed back. Ever!”

Somehow I got over it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145305.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Im banned from a cafe in a town in North Wales; neither of which Id been to prior to this experience. I walked in and the guy behind the counter said You! Ive told you before! Youre banned! I said, confusedly Ive never been here before, but he just pointed at the door, so I turned around and left. Almost 30 years ago.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145299.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. In college, at the local college book store, I attempted to sell some books back to the store. After hearing what the buyback value was, a guy behind me said hed pay $20 more for my books (he was taking the same course the next semester sand the stores mark up would by 100%). The bookstore owner warned me if I sold to this other dude, Id be banned for life. I told him money makes the world go round and took my extra twenty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145300.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. My uncle got us banned from a mom and pops diner in the 90s.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Got banned from a John Lewis (kinda upscale retail gaff in the uk) for browsing items. This was pre covid too. The jobsworth of a guard came up and told me to leave since I was and I quote just picking stuff up and putting them back again like no s**t sherlock thats how browsing in a physical store works. So now Im banned from John Lewis</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145302.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. The prison I used to work at.

I had tried numerous times to receive therapy to treat PTSD I gained while working the job and thanks to the HR taking their vacation was not able to get it and the administrative assistant warden told me, quite literally, officers dont need therapy and if they do then they arent cut out to be officers and refused to help me find help.

When they learned (somehow) that I had sought therapy on my own, they attempted to place me on indefinite administrative leave citing officer has conducted themselves in a manner unfitting their position

So yeah. I sued them and quit and they banned me for life... from their prison.

I called my bank to tell them to not let them withdraw from my account since they had my checking account information. My bank said they have multiple situations happen with planet fitness about their Unusual financial practices. 2 months later I got a letter from planet fitness saying I’m banned from ever signing up with them again. Planet fitness is a POS corporation.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145304.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. There was a roller rink in town that posted on social media that they were having a deal on handmade pizzas and a pitcher of soda to try and drum up business.

The picture clearly showed a digiorno pizza and I commented saying that it was. My comment was deleted, and then I went back to say, “you deleted my comment saying that this is a digiorno pizza.”

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I was banned from a grocery store for shop lifting when I was a kid. I ended up working there like a year or 2 later.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145314.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Banned from commenting on a self proclaimed movie stars Facebook account. Hes basically a movie critic these days and only made a single super bad movie but according to him, hes a big shot. In one such post where he was bragging, I replied with a photo of him in which I photoshopped his face on a street vendor selling bananas. Got banned in probably an hour.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145316.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Not me, but an ex. He walked into a Best Buy to look at Fitbits. He picked one up, concealed it and walked into the restroom to steal it. What he didnt know was that a Best Buy employee was in the restroom and heard him opening the package. He walked out of the stall, Fitbit on his wrist and came fact to face with the employee. They charged him and he spent a night in jail. He was most assuredly banned after that.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145317.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. I stole some cd’s from Best Buy when I was 13. I’ve gone back a million times since my ban. Never stole anything ever again though.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145318.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. I’m banned from Facebook because I named myself “Eric Cartman”. From instagram, the same reason. From Tandem, actually no reason really. When I tried to log in the other day, I was already banned and could no longer sign up.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145319.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Tescos - For ripping an enormous fart onto one of the employees who was bent down stacking a shelf. In my defence, this woman had told me to f**k off a few minutes previous when I asked where the Pepsi was.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145321.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Not me but a friend was banned from our local library because she was playing around and ended up knocking over all the bookshelves.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145322.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Was banned from every sainsburys for life. Got arrested for nicking a couple things. Police officer taking my prints at the station was telling me that the ban is unenforceable and not to take any notice of it. So nothing really happened except Ive grown as a person and no longer do bad things</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145324.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. Got banned from my local target because I pressed on a bunch of squeaky toys all at once and caused a noisy disturbance.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145325.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. I got my mom banned for life from a local grocery store because apparently when i was 3 or 4 I wanted a toothbrush really bad and when she said no I put the toothbrush in her purse when she wasnt looking and then she got caught on the way out and banned from the store.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145326.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. A local non-name brand dvd store when I was a kid. I tripped and knocked over a shelf of dvds near the entrance.

Banned for life. The store closed a few years later so it ended up being for the duration of their life.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145327.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. I was banned for 99 years while my cousin was banned for life at knott’s berry farm in California after he jokingly asked the staff what they’ll do if he had hydrogen napalm in his water bottle.. They had to shut down the theme park for the rest of the day due to a bomb threat and bomb squad escorted us out. Good thing we weren’t asked to go to a police station, but that was one hell of an experience for me. I’ve never gone to any theme parks with him after that.

<span style="font-size:4em">31. Was a kid and stole some pogs from K-Mart…got banned from the store and arrested for theft under $5K. Had to do community service.

<span style="font-size:4em">32. I started asking silly prompt questions on the WoW off-topic forum.

The kind you occasionally see on askreddit or the other ask subs, but this was way before reddit took off.

A mod deemed them to be spam and permabanned me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145330.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">33. I was banned from a discord server for having a profile picture they identified as an anime profile picture, and that meant that I was a weeb, but it was not from an anime, but from a video game.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87145331.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
