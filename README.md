<span style="font-size:4em">9. The act of hitting someone in the head won’t actually knock them out. It’s more likely to kill them.

## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">24 Disturbing Facts That Ruined Our Day</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Flies dont have teeth. So, when they land on your sandwich and want to eat some, they barf up the contents of their stomach (often containing another animals shit) so the digestive enzymes can get on the food and then they eat. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167852.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. There are 32 missing nuclear weapons. And those are only the ones that we know of. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167853.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. There are guys with a fetish to cut off their penises. There’s even a subreddit dedicated to it. I found out about it a few months ago and it still haunts me. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167854.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. In my country some women rent babies to beg money with in the streets. They make them drink a pill that would make them sleep. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167855.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Anything can happen to anyone at any moment. I had my first seizure at 18. No family member has had epilepsy before. Never take anything for granted. It can all change in an instant.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167856.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Because of pregnant women, the average number of skeletons inside a human body is greater than one.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167857.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Often, burnt bodies are found in the same stance, known as the “Boxer Pose” due to muscles contracting from heat. It’s an incredibly disturbing looking thing, I first heard about it from my Grandfather that fought in Burma. During the war he was present at a Burmese funeral in which the cadaver was burnt on a pyre. Just as the flames began to singe the corpse, it sat up straight. The Burmese, of course, got a good laugh out of the British soldiers collectively shitting themselves, as contractions due to heat during cremation is apparently rather common. Doesn’t make it any less creepy. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167858.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Cyanide poisoning is an incredibly painful way to die. Cyanide was what Jonestown consumed for mass suicide. Parents were instructed to give it to their children and convinced the crying was just fear. Edit: For those asking about how cyanide works. If memory serves from when I first read this and listened to the audio recordings, it feels like a massive, massive heart attack. It may not have taken too much time, but any time greater than instantis too long to suffer before death. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167860.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. During World War 2, Japan bombed China with fleas infected with the bubonic plague. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167861.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. The horrendous practice of having a “dancing boy” AKA child sex slave in some regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. When families are poor they will sell their child to be a “dancing boy”. The children are frequently killed if they resist. It’s a rough watch but the documentary The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan covers this awful practice pretty well. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167862.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Pelicans are some of the most demonic birds in existence, if not some of the most demonic creatures. Pelicans will go into other birds nests, shove the parents out of the nest. They will then swallow babies whole, fly back to their own nests, and regurgitate the still half alive, partially digested babies, to their own babies for them to consume. Some pelicans are literally raised on the partially digested, living flesh of other baby birds. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167863.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Chris Farleys last words were dont leave me. He said it to the prostitute he was with who then stole his watch and took a picture of him dead/dying. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167864.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. 1/3 of all people who break their hip die within the year.... So please tape pillows to your elderly relatives.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167865.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. One of Mayhem’s band members committed suicide. When he was found by his bandmate, pictures were taken and it became the new album cover.

<span style="font-size:4em">16. That it takes three generations for you to be completely forgotten. Think about how you viewed your great grandparents. Sure you probably loved them but for most people their great grandparents die and are forgotten as you live your life. One day that will be all of us. Disappearing into the void, none to remember who we were, what our life was like or what we believed in. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167867.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. You can not prove that anyone else is real. The only thing you know for sure is you are conscious. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167868.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. I forget what its called but sometimes the artery that runs right next to your esophagus, over years of recurrent acid reflux can rupture. It fills your stomach with blood in seconds which causes you to vomit, which causes more damage. It fills you up with blood so fast that it eventually fills your lungs. This takes maybe a minute or two and is almost always fatal unless it happens to occur while youre in a hospitalYour last few minutes alive are spent vomiting pints of blood and then drowning in it. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167870.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Anesthesia awareness is a thing. Given the effects of anesthetics preventing the formation of new memories, its possible it always happens and we just dont remember it afterwards. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167871.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. By the time you show the symptoms of rabies, its already too late. (It can also be dormant for a year before you show those symptoms.) </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167872.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. The Nutty Putty Cave accident. Google for full disturbing details / a map of the cave, but basically a guy got stuck caving in a very narrow unmapped tunnel, UPSIDE-DOWN. They could not get him out, but almost did, one of the rescuers made eye contact with him apparently but then their pulley system broke and he fell further down. Unfortunately he ended up dying of cardiac arrest from being upside-down for so long and they couldn’t get him out / never retrieved the body because it was too dangerous for rescuers. Truly so disturbing, I’ve thought about it probably once a week since I found out about it a few months ago. Edit: even more disturbing now that someone gave this a wholesome award. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167873.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. If an elephants mate dies then they can die from broken heart syndrome. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167874.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Hotels rarely clean their ice machines.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167875.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">20 Ground Rules for Boob-Watching from the Women Folk Themselves</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. If it’s a quick glance, it’s fine. That’s normal and feels mostly involuntary on behalf of the person looking. I notice but it doesn’t bother me. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121137/87169274/etiquette-02.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> If they stare at my boobs while other people are talking—or worse, while I’m talking—that makes me uncomfortable. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/011159/87169320/etiquette-06.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> Fortunately, I’ve experienced glancing a lot more frequently than staring. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013434/87169369/etiquette-13.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. When women wear graphic t shirts with writing on their chest I’m always hesitant to read it because I don’t want to look like a jackass. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013504/87169371/etiquette-12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I can tell when someone is reading my shirt versus just staring at my boobs. I don’t mind people stopping and taking a good look at the text, I know it’s hard to read, I’ll even turn and fully face them so they can read it properly. I don’t mind this at all, if I’m going to slap a message on my tits I’m doing it cause I want people to read the message. No biggie! </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121114/87169272/etiquette-03.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> In fact asking a woman “what does your shirt say” is a really good way to break the ice. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/015227/87169386/etiquette-17.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> I’ve seen multiple people mention feeling uncomfortable reading name tags. It’s always okay to read name tags! They’re literally there to be read. I’ve seen some women put their name tags on their upper sleeve if they felt uncomfortable with drawing attention to their left tit so in that instance you’ll know a woman doesn’t want you staring at her chest. If you’re really uncomfortable with reading a name tag that’s okay, just introduce yourself and then ask their name. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121201/87169276/etiquette-05.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Picasso has been commonly characterized as a womanizer and a misogynist, being quoted as having said to one of his mistresses, Françoise Gilot, Women are machines for suffering. He later told her, For me there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats. In her memoir, Picasso, My Grandfather, Marina Picasso writes of his treatment of women, He submitted them to his animal sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them, and crushed them onto his canvas. After he had spent many nights extracting their essence, once they were bled dry, he would dispose of them.Of the several important women in his life, two, Marie-Thèrése Walter, a mistress, and Jacqueline Roque, his second wife, committed suicide. Others, notably his first wife Olga Khokhlova, and his mistress Dora Maar, succumbed to nervous breakdowns. His son, Paulo, developed a fatal alcoholism due to depression. His grandson, Pablito, also committed suicide when he was barred by Jacqueline Roque from attending the artists funeral. - Admirable-Suit5387</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170048.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

And when it came down to it, he died from an OD, so for someone who was so quick to fire anyone over a simple mistake and he so critical of weakness, it turns out he had some hidden weaknesses of his own. Also, from all accounts Jim Morrison was an awful awful person. - BottomShelfWhiskey</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170054.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky14" id="linky13">24 Pieces of Advice That Sound Crazy but Aren’t</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Do you understand, that if you try to endlessly stack bricks, no matter how perfect you do it, they will fall over? My boss told me this after I burned out. Just says that no matter how well you plan your work, too much is too much. -u/IsabellaCps</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168611.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Make them tell you no. Its great when youre not sure if you should apply for a job, go for a promotion or a raise, or do something youre afraid of. Dont be so worried about getting told no or failing, youll surprise yourself. -u/Marnett05</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168612.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “If you sit quietly while everyone else f*cks up, you’re going to win big!” -John Oliver. I’ve gotten multiple jobs and school opportunities by just doing my work and not being a loud moron. -u/Redqueenhypo</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168613.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. From my 7-year-old daughter…I still laugh about it today. If you’re ever in an awkward situation with someone or need to just go away, you could always pretend to choke on something. I don’t know where this came from but it’s funny AND it works. You just run away to get a glass of water. -u/Typical-me-</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168614.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If you need to remember something, write it 3x or say it out loud 3x. Always weird when you repeat something verbally 3x, especially names. -u/RainingRetro</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168615.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. If looking for something in a low light environment, try to use your peripheral vision. I read about it in an old WWII manual about aerial combat at night. It has something to do with how eyes work. It has helped me many times over the years. For finding stuff in a darkened room, or outside in a field at night, not aerial combat. -u/BMLortz</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168616.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. No one thinks about you as much as you do. Meaning we’re all worried about people thinking about the tiniest embarrassing things we do, when no one really cares. It gave me freedom to take on more challenges and not worry about failure. -u/derpitaway</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168629.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Dont give excuses unless they ask for it. I.E. if you are late for work, just say that you are late. Not why you are late. -u/Gurkeprinsen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168617.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Time will pass either way—if you want to work to get better at something, accomplish a long-term goal, or change careers or credentials, don’t look at the 2-5 years and think you’ll be too old. If you’re 24 and want to go to college, you’ll be 28 in four years with or without a degree regardless of what you do in that time. -u/Mild-Intrigue</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168618.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Anger and remorse are shadow companions, with remorse always a step behind. I took control over my temper issues by reminding myself of this one-liner. Hope this works for you, too! -u/Cogito747</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168619.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. It’s only embarrassing if you’re embarrassed. The older I get, the more I understand this one. -u/PB-JAM</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168620.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Fail quickly, as in: If your plan may not succeed, better to find out next week than next year. Helped me quit a suffocating job and dig into my own business 10/10. -u/NNakedLunchDate</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168621.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. If you cant fight the fear, do it scared. Got me through a lot of anxiety. -u/ChasingAlnilam</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168622.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. My mother always said Go back to basics whenever I was struggling mentally. I disregarded it for years but now I live by it. I only utilize this way of living during desperate survival times, but its amazing advice. -u/Staceystallion1</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168623.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Don’t beat yourself up forever. Beat yourself up once then move on. Mr. Homer Simpson. -u/Amy-Paradise</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168624.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. If you want to buy something, wait 24 hours and if you still want to buy it afterwards then buy it. This has really cut my impulse buying down and has made saving money extremely easy. -u/ThaMuffMango</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168625.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. People don’t always remember what you say but how you make them feel. -u/THGilmore</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168626.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. When writing an e-mail, leave the recipient field until last. -u/Ocsttiac</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168627.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Stressed, upset, panic attack, ennui? Put an ice cube in your hand. Move it around your hand until it slowly melts. It takes about 5 minutes. Primary Effect: the cold on your skin grabs your brains attention. You stop thinking about what was stressing you out and feel present in the moment. Secondary Effect: the cold cools your blood, which goes into your heart and slows down the beating.

As your heartbeat slows to maintain your body heat, your lungs breathe more slowly as well. It forces you to breathe, which calms you down. After 5 minutes of this, you will feel much calmer, if slightly drippy. -u/LeskoLesko</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168631.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. I tell my daughter to add the word yet after anything about lacking something. I dont know how to play this game. Becomes I dont know how to play this game yet. That sort of thing.

Its meant to redirect negative self admonishment into a drive to grow and learn. And apparently, its sinking in because she will say something like Ugh, I cant make it up this hill! while were out bike riding and then catch me looking at her, give a big eye roll and go ...yet! in the exact tone you think a teenage girl would use. Then she ends up sometimes just rage-succeeding to prove the point, its great. Shes going to be at least 3 times better than me, low as that bar may be. -u/Zambeeni</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168634.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
