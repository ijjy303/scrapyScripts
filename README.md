<span style="font-size:4em">1. “I shot an internal promotional video for Make a Wish once. I got to read through a big book of wishes they had granted. Some of them were so extravagant and amazing. Family vacations, celebrity meetings. And then I saw a 3 year old who wished for a banana split for breakfast. And thats what they gave him. No one was like ayo. Wish higher. - josiemarcellino </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191579.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “I helped host a visit to a planetarium by a kid whose wish was to go to the moon. The front office folks thought I could just give her a personal tour of the planetarium and show her some nice high-resolution visuals, but I thought she deserved better than that. I commissioned a jeweler friend and meteorite enthusiast to make a silver crescent moon necklace, which he graciously donated to the cause, and I donated a small lunar meteorite from my own collection. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191580.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

It was a gorgeous necklace very much to the credit of my friends artistry and generosity. We couldnt take her to the moon so we gave it to her instead. She was thrilled, but later said her real highlight of the trip was the astronaut ice cream. Ah, kids.” - aluminum26</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191581.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “My daughter was a Make A Wish kid. She asked to go to Australia to meet the Wiggles. Unfortunately, she wasnt able to travel that far (we live in the US) health-wise. She made a second wish, to meet Captain America. We never told Cap that he was a backup wish after the Wiggles were a no-go. LOL” - Allyson244</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191582.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “When my sister was 5 and I was 8, she had cancer and had the opportunity to make a wish. When our mom and the make-a-wish person sat down with her, they told her she could wish for whatever she wanted. She just kept saying she wanted macaroni. They kept saying but it can be anything you want!, yet she simply wanted macaroni and cheese. After some strong encouragement to think bigger, and the make-a-wish person suggesting Disneyland, she chose to go to Disneyland.” - tinbasher97</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191583.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “My friend, I’m 14 and my good buddy had ALL leukemia. He asked for a ride in a fighter jet and he somehow got it! I was surprised because the doctors would say how his bones were getting fragile and weaker and I guess I thought the G force of the jet would hurt him but he was fine and had a blast. He’s doing better now and is scheduled out in about 3 months :)” - IronNuggetsYT</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191584.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “I was granted a wish after beating brain cancer in 2015. They flew my mum and I out to the capital city of our state and we stayed in the flashiest, most expensive hotel suite with all the bells and whistles. We got free dinner, drinks, and dessert on arrival, and got to chill in the VIP lounge while we were waiting for our room. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191585.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Our room was decorated with teddy bears and chocolates and MAW decorations. The next day we were chauffeured to the local mall in a limo and I went on an eleven hour shopping spree with a pre-loaded VISA card and bought every solitary thing you would imagine a 16 year old girl wanting. I ended up having to buy another suitcase to take everything home with me but it was the most epic 3 days of my life. I’ll never forget it.” - lizzierose456</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191586.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “A friend of mine is a K9 police officer. He helped Make-A-Wish grants a wish to a set of twins with the deadliest form of Cystic Fibrosis. Most of the time kids with CF aren’t allowed to be around others with it because of cross-infecting bacteria. Them being twins shortens their life expectancy even more. Well, these 10-year-old boys wanted to meet a police dog. My friend and some of his buddies upped the wish and during their meeting of his dog they got called to help solve three “crimes” in their town. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191587.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

 They pulled over a high jacker, found and arrested a robber and helped find a “missing” six-year old (my friend’s nephew). The town police department gave them certificates and honorary police badges for their work. Around 200 people showed up to where they got their awards to cheer them on. At their eleventh birthday they gave my friend a plaque they made with their dad thanking him for the best day ever.” - hisamsmith</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191588.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

So I showed her the ropes, we made all kinds of stuff, that were on the surface kind of random, candied bacon, cornbread, prosciutto-wrapped Boursin cheese-stuffed asparagus, a sweet tea brined pork chop, a sorel garnish salad type thing and some other Cool garnishes. We were having fun, I then made a purée out of the cornbread and let her plate up the dish a few different ways to show how you can play with ingredients and height to showcase different parts of the dish. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191594.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

She had a blast. It was only at the end when the father came up to me In tears that I realized what was goin on. In the moment I was a little upset because nobody told me. But I realized after it was for the best. I probably would not have been as bright and vibrant with the “lessons” had I of known. But it was a fulfilling experience for sure.

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “I worked at a hospice and we had a wishing program. One of our patients, 24 year old with brain cancer, wanted to hold a sloth. Apparently, sloths are very nervous creatures, so its a little tricky to actually hold one. I found a local company that does visits to schools and whatnot who had a sloth. Sloths only poop about once a week and the sloth could only travel the day after he pooped (because they get nervous, any longer than that and the sloth has stress diarrhea). </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191596.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

So basically, we had to wait until the sloth pooped and then set up the visit for the next day. The sloth pooped on Thanksgiving, so we set up the visit for the next morning. The patient was able to hold and pet a very sweet sloth. The patient died about three weeks later, and I am very happy I was able to help give her some joy in her final weeks.” - ByteAboutTown</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191597.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “I worked at a LEGO retail store in the 2000s and Make-A-Wish approached us for a child with terminal Osteosarcoma who wanted to be in the store for a day. LEGO, unfortunately, denied the request (which surprised myself and the rest of the staff because LEGO was a pretty great company). Staff decided to honor the request ourselves. We closed the store early on a Sunday, then invited the kid and family in. He had a full run of the store, we collectively paid for like $1000 worth of toys for him to take home, and just spent the entire evening building w/e he wanted. He died a few months later </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191598.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

We gave him a lab coat and a stethoscope and let him tag along and see x-rays and ultrasounds and watch surgeries. I brought my dog in so he could try the ultrasound on her. He seemed to enjoy it.

You meet Brandon and go help him clear out this dungeon with 2 really fucking hard bosses, was a lotta fun. At the end U get a gem you can socket that lets you summon Brandon into battle as a follower, pretty cool.

<span style="font-size:4em">1. “Posting way too much Information or pictures of your toddlers and children on social media. It will stay on the internet forever and some of the posts will be very embarrassing later on.

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “posting about almost every aspect of your life on social media. I posted some pretty cringe stuff as a kid that is still floating around somewhere, and that was before social media became big.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “Facebook has explicitly encouraged its users to break down privacy barriers between different aspects of their life, e.g. work, school, and family. This is not a theoretical effect but an intentional one; Zuck has explicitly said that in his view, people who maintain boundaries between different parts of their life lack integrity and that its Facebooks goal to promote integrity in this specific sense. This is deeply dysfunctional.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195054.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “The destruction of public education (squeezing and outright sabotage of public schools, prohibitive costs for secondary education). The normalization of being undereducated, either through apathy or because of forces outside your control. The idea that opinion is equal to fact and that sticking to your original viewpoint is heroic. Yeah, your studies may say that, but this is how I FEEL about it and similar arguments. The reason we are no longer a minor species of omnivorous hunter-gatherers is our ability to pass along knowledge to others. Each generation building on the achievements of prior generations is the path to progress in health, quality of life, equality, production and so much more.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195060.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
