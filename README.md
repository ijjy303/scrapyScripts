<span style="font-size:4em">3. TIL that Charles Darwin often gave his old papers to his children for them to doodle on. Thus, much of what survives of his original Origin of Species manuscript represents the best of his childrens writing and drawings, rather than the best of his work.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/03/31/021108/87136121/125256_ms-dar-00185-000-00585_full_1220.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. TIL that tennis shoes were originally made for the British Navy when on their slippery decks. When the shoes came into the market in 1892, they were known as plimsolls.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. TIL about Cynane, Alexander the Greats warrior half-sister. Unlike most women of the time, she was given a martial education, and led her own troops into battle.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. TIL From 1979 until 2007, residents of Naco, Mexico, and Naco, United States, played volleyball over the border fence, batting the ball back and forth between the two countries.

## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">13 Secrets Companies Don’t Want You To Know</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. When buying contact lenses, the same contacts that you get for three months, one month, two weeks, and one day are the same lenses. But I didnt tell you that.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135035.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. So I worked at Taco Bell for almost three years, and Im here to tell you all the truth. So, ground beef is in fact real ground beef. It just has a lot of water and seasoning in it. But its safe, I promise. The grilled chicken - I promise its real grill chicken. Youre fine. Go ahead and eat it. The shredded chicken - run, run the opposite direction away from the shredded chicken. You can swap out the shredded chicken for grilled chicken on any of the items, FYI, but the shredded chicken is all the bits of the chicken that you dont want to eat. And I promise you, eventually youre going to get a bone.

Also, the steak, so disappointing. Cause I know its like the most appetizing thing. Its 90% gelatin. If it gets left out for any amount of time, it turns into a slab of gelatin. Just trust me and stay away from shredded chicken and steak.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135026.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Any time you pay for shipping and handling, youre never actually paying for shipping and handling. This is actually a company secret for most companies youll order from online. You see, once a year, UPS and FedEx actually have to go to these companies and renegotiate their service terms for the entire year.

You see, FedEx and UPS charge these companies yearly to actually do business with them. So theyll probably charge them like, I believe, the company I worked for, was $100,000 a year. But every day, they would show up to pick up the packages that you had to ship. So heres an example. You decided to go on Barnes & Noble and you order a book off them for $10. The tax on that item is about a $1.79. So in total, youre paying about $12 for that book. You get down to your checkout and youre going out for shipping and handling, which is what you see is another $7 added into the charge. So youre thinking naturally well, thats just to pay to get it to my house. No, unfortunately, that $7 they just charged you is going right into the companys account.

So basically if they do this all year long, they could end up making more than $100,000. So more or less, you guys are paying for their shipping costs and youre helping them profit as well. Have a good day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135037.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I worked for GameStop from 2011 to 2018. I was a holiday hire, assistant store manager. Knew how to do store manager work. Read the entire employee handbook because it would be freaking boring. Did every quiz, everything, all of it. So, because I read the handbook, I know for a fact that if you open a brand new game and you declare when you return it that it was too mature for your child, based on the ESRB rating, they have to return it. It is in the handbook. It states specifically: can return new open games if it was too mature.

So do with that information what you will.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135029.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I was a manager at a McDonalds. I worked there for about three years. For the tea, they have a red jug for the sweet tea and a green jug for the unsweet tea. These jugs are four gallons big and for every four gallons of the red jug with the sweet tea, there is a full four-pound bag of sugar emptied into it.

One pound per gallon of tea. Yeah, I stopped drinking the tea after I realized that because thats nasty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135028.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I have worked at quite a few restaurants in New York city, maybe like four or five, I think. And I promise you this. If youve been to a restaurant in Manhattan, they have rats. They have rats. I did not say mice. Im not talking Ratatouille. Im talking, Master Splinter - big, huge rats.

And youre like, well, I am not seeing them? Because rats are afraid of noise. So when you come in in the morning, thats when theyre there. When you open the restaurant, theyre there. But then once the people started moving around more, you go around clanging pots and pans and the more people show up, the more the rats stay away.

Im telling you, especially if its Manhattan, especially if its accessible from the first floor. Oh, baby! Yes. Yes, that restaurant has rats. I remember going into work on days, you walk in the morning, you just smell that a rat has died somewhere in the walls, somewhere inside of a booth and you cant find it.

So the amount of covering up... air freshener and candles, yeah. New York City Manhattan restaurants are nasty. And theres probably going to be a bunch of us commenting a little thing like, oh yeah. Guaranteed. And anyone that tells you the restaurant does not have that - dont believe them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135027.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I only worked at Claires for like a summer, so I didnt have that much time there, but I do know - dont get your ears pierced at Claires. Dont let your child get their ears pierced at Claires. And definitely do not let your infant get their ears pierced at Claires.

I only had to watch my manager do two piercings before I was allowed to start doing them. And I only ever practiced on a teddy bear before doing it on an actual human being. A literal teddy. We were told to lie to the families. If they were worried about their child having any type of allergic reaction to the metal, we were told to tell them that the safest metal we had was the 24-karat gold option, which was obviously the most expensive, but thats not true. The safest metal at Claires is actually the cheapest for $15. You get surgical-grade titanium. Yes, theres less options and they look less pretty. They dont have as many gemstones, but you can always change it later. And its the only metal Claires has thats surgical grade.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135030.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. For two years, I worked at the largest social media company in the world. Lets call them Smacemook or Vetta. I worked in advertising operations and yes, they are listening.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135025.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Im gonna speak in a little bit of a code so that maybe I dont get sued. I worked for a person who was the head of plastics for a company that kind of sounds a little bit like Ronson and Ronson. And when I was working for them, I walked into their home with a plastic container and they said, Take that out of my home right now.

And I was like, Hey, youre the head of plastics for Ronson and Ronson? Why would it be not okay to bring plastic into your house? And I was like, Its BPA-free. And they looked at me dead in my face and they were like, Take that out of my house now. There is no plastics allowed in my house whatsoever. BPA-free means nothing. It just means we replaced it with a chemical equally or more toxic that just hasnt been banned yet. And I will never forget that. Do with that information what you will, but I do not use plastics in my home when I can help it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135031.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I used to work for Starbucks a long time ago, and heres some secrets. Most of the time, we used to spell your name wrong on purpose. We just get told, Spell their name wrong. Theyll do free advertising for us. Youre going to put it on your social media, you are going to talk about it. If it goes viral, youve just done an advertisement for the company.

If youre rude to your barista, they will give you decaf coffee. Tastes the same. Youre just not going to get the coffee kick you need. Likewise, if youre nice to your barista, you are going to get stuff knocked off. They wont charge you for extra shots. They wont charge you for extra syrup. Theyll make your coffee beautifully. The love you give them is the love youre getting back. Look for the person with a black apron. Now, I dont know if they do this anymore, but those people are coffee masters. They have been trained to make beautiful coffee. They know what theyre doing. Theyll make it expertly.

Most of the staff will have tried all the foods and all that. So get them to make you something that they think is nice. Cause Im telling you, it is always a winning combination. Might not be on the menu, but theyll mix a couple of flavors together to make you something beautiful.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135032.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I have not seen anybody talking about Pandora. Okay. Pandora jewelry. When you shop at Pandora, youre literally shopping for sentimental value because theres not a single charm or a bracelet you can take to a pawn shop and actually get any cash back for it.

Theres so little gold in that jewelry that its worthless. Its all silver, its all cubic zirconia. You wouldnt find a Swarovski, a diamond, a crystal at all. In that store is all CZ stones that we find anywhere.

And two, it varies from franchise to franchise. I worked at a few, some are really good at being organized and stuff, but a lot of them - its dirty. They dont keep things up. You could probably look in between the things on the floor and you might find a charm underneath there, honestly, that filthy.

And we all steal, all the employees.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135033.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. So I used to work for Bath & Body Works, and this really isnt a secret, but I do get asked this a lot still to this day. And most of the employees should still be wearing a pin on their apron that says like a hundred percent guaranteed. But for those that keep asking, you can still return those old used products and tell them you did not like them and exchange them item for item. Even burnt candles, lotions, sprays, wallflowers, soaps. Yeah. All those. Just go in there and tell them that you did not like it. The fragrance, its not burning right, or you didnt like the lotion, whatever. They dont ask questions. They will let you exchange them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135034.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. I used to work at Victorias Secret. If you like the semi-annual sale, buy whatever you want, and then go back in 14 days and you can price adjust. They will let you do it (or theyre supposed to). They dont like it, but if youre nice, you can at least buy that much additional stuff now that everythings half off.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135036.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Weird mother on my flight,I was returning back to Istanbul, watching my predownloaded stuff on Netflix. There was a mother next to me with a probably 4-5 year old kid. At first everything was fine; she was distracting her kid with her phone, I was watching the season 4 of rick and morty, then her battery ran out.She gave her kid some toy but after a while kid started crying. I had a powerbank with me and before my battery got to %20, I plugged mine in.After a while she asked me for my powerbank, but I needed it for my phone. She saidIm an adult and you MUST respect you adults, hand it to meShe suddenly turned into a b****.I kindly said I needed it for my phone and pointed a power outlet and said you can use this one.I re opened Netflix and watched the season I downloaded before being onboard. She called a personnel and said that my flight mode wasnt on and I was using Cellular.I showed the downloaded logo and my flight mode and this dumb mother gave up.Then the personnel showed the same outlet I showed to the ****** sitting next to me and her face was priceless.Good thing it wasnt a big problem, the flight went mostly peaceful and calm</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87134094.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. So, A few decades ago, I went from 70 to 0 too fast one night and ended up in the hospital with a pen in my teeth signing a form on a clipboard held over my head that they could cut off both of my hands and my right leg because they were all so mangled that there was a less than 50% chance of them being saved.18 hours of surgery and I woke up with everything I went in there with (and a few extra metal parts to boot) but it took years and a couple of dedicated physical therapists (whom I lovingly refer to as Helga and Ursula the Bitch-Goddesses) for me to be able to walk and use my reconstructed hands.Ive had 4 follow up surgeries since then and I can now walk without a limp but its still difficult to walk very far without pain so I have a handicapped placard on my car. I found out real quick that theres an attitude among handicapped placard owners. They all seem to think that theyre more deserving than you of the spot that you just parked in. That plus FedEx drivers use them indiscriminately.My first experience with FedEx was when I went to get my name registered on the sewer and water utilities for the house we just moved to. There was only one handicapped spot and a FedEx delivery truck was parked in it. So I parked sideways and blocked him in then hobbled my way into the building with my cane. (I was still in physical therapy then)About 5 minutes later, I see the FedEx guy come up:FedEx Guy: Who owns the Silver Infinity outside?Me: That would be meFedEx guy: Youre blocking me inMe: You parked in the handicapped spotFedEx guy: I was only going to be there a few minutesMe: Well now youre going to be there until I finish my business here.FedEx guy: You cant do that!Me: We can call the sheriff and see which one of us gets a ticket.But the Entitled Bitch portion of the story happened a few years later. By then, I was able to walk without my cane and I had encountered more than one of these so I knew what was about to happen and I had prepared my response ahead of time.I had just parked and gotten out of my car and was walking into Wally World when I see the Cadillac moving slowly by with the window rolling down and the EB about to lay out her case on why she deserved my spot and I didnt.EB: Whats your problem?Me: Excuse me?EB: You dont look like youre handicapped.Me: Thank you! Ive worked really hard to be able to walk without a limpEB: I dont think youre really handicapped.Me: You could have stopped talking after the first three words of that last sentence and been entirely correct.EB: So whats wrong with you?Me: *sigh* If you must know, I lost my foot in an accident.EB: Really? How did that happen?Me: I broke it off in some nosey bitchs ass!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87134097.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. The story happened this week on an international flight. The layout of the plane was 3+3 seat rows, and sitting in front of me was a family of mom, dad and a 4-5 year old son on the middle. Our flight got delayed a good deal so the kid was probably already bored out of his mind. Right after boarding the boy takes out the seat table and starts bashing it repeatedly like hes tryna to smack the devil out of it. After 10+ hits the dad asks him to stop as the person in front of them was getting visibly frustrated.Dad: Stop now, youll break it and the angry man will come take youMom: I dont care what they say, its a child and if they have a problem with this they should get up and relocate!As soon as Ive heard it I was furious and low key spent the rest of the flight hating on her. There were no vacant seats on the plane, the consistent seating is important due to covid rules, and, most importantly, what traits is she trying to bring up in her son?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87134098.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. I posted a story about my ex sister-in-law and felt like this spoke more to the type of person she is on the inside.She and her cousin got two cats and brought them home, made sure they were fed, and that was the end of it. They never played with the cats and even changed their names after a couple months because they were just so fickle and indifferent about the pets they chose to adopt.One day, they got sick of the cats that were super antisocial because they never received any type of attention but negative because SIL and her cuz were so fed up with the situation. So they took the cats to the pound. They were warned that the animals would be euthanized if they weren’t adopted after 30 days and to come back and get them if they didn’t want that to happen.The date came and went, and these two grown adults (one in her 30’s) “forgot” and let their cats be put down. I learned of this after the fact because they were so ashamed they swore their family to secrecy, but the tea was spilled anyway. Pretty horrifying.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87134099.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. This happens way too often. We usually turn off the automatic doors around a minute or two before we close, but it doesnt get locked until exactly 8 (or whenever we are closing), we have had numerous people push the doors open at 8 and look like a deer in the headlights when we say we are closed.Imagine being so entitled that you force one of the doors open and are surprised when you are kicked out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87134100.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
