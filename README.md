<span style="font-size:4em">21. “This is gate-blocked road access to some cell towers. Why so many locks, and how would someone even open it?”
Answer: It’s a shared access gate. You can open the gate if you have 1 key that fits one of the locks. It’s necessary when the keys belong to different people or organizations. If someone loses the keys, you can just restore 1 key instead of making new copies for everyone.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138413.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. “Purchased in Africa, was told something about ancient sailing.”
Answer: They say it’s an astrolabe. It is one of the most ancient astronomical tools to measure the horizontal angles and find the longitudes and latitudes of celestial bodies.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138414.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. “Okay, I know it’s a chair, but what’s with the extended arms?”
Answer: It looks like a plantation/planter’s chair. You’d put your sore, swollen legs up on the arms after sitting on a horse all day, like a pregnant woman with her legs up in the same fashion. This is why the back is so sloped as well. If you sit up straight, it wouldn’t be comfortable to put your legs up like that, but in a reclined position, it’s good for blood and air flow.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138416.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. “Just moved to a new apartment, found this in the living room. What is it?”

<span style="font-size:4em">29. “It’s a plaque with numbers inscribed on it. Found on the sidewalk outside a building at my university.”

## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">35 Pieces of Knowledge That Feel Illegal to Know</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Read a personal finance book that recommended calling your providers once a year (credit card companies, TV/internet providers, cell phone company, etc) and demand a lower rate or price. I’ve been following that advice for two years and have not been denied once.

Last week I saw a commercial for my internet provider offering a super low introductory rate so I called to demand that I get that rate. They said no problem and now I save an extra $700 a year because of a 5 minute call. I am a very passive introvert so it’s not the most easy or comfortable thing but the money I save is worth it. They may so no initially but if you ask a few times or ask to speak to their supervisor they very usually give in.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138062.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. In Canada you can record any conversation with someone without their knowledge, unless it is in furtherance of an offence.

I had to do this with an auto restoration shop in order to do a Visa chargeback when they did nothing to my car but steal parts for almost a year (Curtis Customs in Nova Scotia - I don’t mind mentioning them because there are already news stories about their scams)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138073.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. When I was a kid, my dad taught me how to pick a lock. I became very interested in different kinds of locks and purchased a lock pick set. I practiced for years and became pretty good at certain types of locks. So over the years every now and then, if a neighbor locks themselves out of the house or a friend loses the key to a padlock or a lock box I’ve been able to help. But the reactions I tend to get from people, even while I’m helping them with their lock is mainly one of mistrust. I’m not a cat burglar. I just like locks.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138056.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. (This is England knowledge, other countries may vary) If you are struggling to pay bills, make water the first one you skip. Access to water is protected by law so the utility supplier cannot cut you off.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138057.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Well Im in med school and funny enough learning how to not kill a person involves learning about a s**t ton of ways to kill a person</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138058.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. You can ask scientists for their research paper that you usually have to pay money to view in a journal. They are allowed to just email it to you no questions asked and they like to do it!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138059.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Unionization saves you more money than it costs you, you cannot be punished for attempting to do so, and it is NOT in any way illegal, rude, or improper to discuss your salary with your coworkers.

It feels illegal because every company on the f*****g planet has tried to make people think unions are evil monsters trying to get you to pay union dues for no return. This is false because union dues are much less expensive than a company underpaying you and trying to work you to death, which a union fights against. Unions are there to prevent worker exploitation, stop it if people were being exploited when they got there, and get you a fair wage that will actually let you live off of one job instead of needing 4-5 or to work criminal amounts of overtime.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138060.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Totally another route of what everyone else is posting but.... the lion at The Animal Kingdom safari ride isnt chained (Disney World park). He is fed a huge piece of meat every morning and sits on a rock that is changed to the perfect temperature for him everyday so he has no reason to attack anyone on the safari ride.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138061.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. One thing I learned is in the state of California if you are squatting a property for five years and have been upkeeping it with proof, you can file a claim of ownership with the courts and take over any property as long as it was deemed that the original owner never tried to remove you within the same timeframe.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138064.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Well, I gave my 9th grade chemistry class a detailed report on diacetylmorphine (heroin) for a project about organic molecules, including how to make it. It was pretty interesting to do and fun to present, but I feel like I broke the law somehow.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138065.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. It is legal to grow opium poppies in the United States, but only if you dont know they can be used to make drugs</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138066.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Creating Nitrogen triiodide. When in liquid form it is stable but once it dries so much as a fly landing on it creates a purple smoke explosion. Its so unstable that alpha radiation can be used to detonate the stuff.

Its actually easy to get the materials and create the stuff. Filled my high school hallway stairs with purple smoke on the last day of school.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138068.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Hospitals have but don’t tell you about a program to reduce your bills depending on how much you make. You can go to their website and find a usually hidden link for financial assistance policies and really cut your bill down</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138070.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I dont know if its still a thing, but if you listen to Pandora radio the songs download into your temp folder under your browser. Just add the. Mp4 after it and you can play it.

I spent lots of college listening to Pandora, and if I liked a song Id save it. If you paused the song in time then the most recent song was the top one in the temp folder.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138071.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. When you have a debt with a collection agency you can pay the debt and then call back a few weeks later and say, “I was told when I called and paid that you’d remove this from my credit score.” And then you ask for documentation saying they’re gonna do it. Apparently collection agencies don’t keep super good records on stuff like that; they just want your money. It worked for me, and I hope it can work for you if you need it in the future.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138072.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. I had a stats prof who used to work for the US government. Im not sure exactly what his job was, but it definitely involved evaluating the status and readiness of nukes, both ours and the USSRs (he was probably at least 70 and had been retired from that job for a while). One day in class he just started talking about the percentage of nukes that fail (ours and theirs) and why they fail and all kinds of other, seemingly sensitive, information. I dont think he would have told us anything classified, but his personality was boisterous and irreverent enough that I am not sure. I literally expected a team of spooks to bust down the door at any minute and drag us all off for interviews in windowless rooms.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138083.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. In regards to military grade bombs and missiles, it takes actual effort to make one go off on the ground. Like, you literally have to go out of your way to arm the fuse, then sit around for a timer to detonate said bomb.

<span style="font-size:4em">32. When youre on a jury you can vote for someone as innocent even if you think they did it.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Any experiment that checks to see if a medicine is safe for pregnant ladies to consume... Would require trials of pregnant ladies consuming the medications before we knew the medications were completely safe.There are precious few Pregnancy Category A medicines.Most medications (like acetaminophen aka Tylenol) given to pregnant women are under Category B, Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.-u/lub-shh-dub</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87138196.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Dr. Curt Richter conducted an experiment with rats that essentially concluded that the presence of hope could prolong the ability to stay alive when faced with life-threatening circumstances.During the first part of the experiment, rats were put in a bucket of water. After about 15 minutes the rat would begin to drown. The scientist plucked the rat out of the bucket of water merely seconds before death. After a couple of days, the scientist repeated this process. However, instead of drowning after 15 minutes of treading water, some of the rats survived for up to 2 and half days.The scientist concluded that the rats were able to continue swimming because they retained the HOPE of being rescued, as this is what they experienced during the first trial.It would be interesting to see how the concept of hope influences humans under similar circumstances.-u/Public_Bullfrog_382</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87138197.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. It would be cool if we could somehow bring back different species of humans that went extinct. Like Neanderthals, Denisovans, etc. and see how they’d differ, if at all, from us if raised in a modern society. It’s been talked about, but likely will never happen due to ethical concerns.-u/jackiepoo0804</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87138199.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

Id like to see an experiment where a child is brought up believing a fictional piece of work like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings is a real religion.Think of it like the Truman Show, but instead of a show its just a household that worships Nic Cage or something.

<span style="font-size:4em">18. My brother and I have talked a lot about a special version of the Olympics where the competitors can use whatever and however many performance-enhancing drugs they want just to push the absolute limits of what humans can do.

## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">29 Stories Of Celebrities Being Jerks</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Ellen Degeneres is a bona fide b*tch. Incredibly rude. My Uncle worked with her, (hes an architect), on some projects and she treated him help like total crap. I couldnt believe it at the time, but Ive heard similar accounts of her bad behavior over the years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138714.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Oprah didn’t tip me on a $200 lunch — instead, she signed a napkin for me and acted like she was doing me a huge favor. The kicker was when she walked in, they gave away all of my other tables so she didn’t have to wait for anything. So I made $4/hour for two hours for the privilege of serving Oprah, and she went on and on about signing a napkin that I never asked for.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138711.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I haven’t met many but Lenny Kravitz stayed at the hotel I worked at. He had the hotel sign an agreement that the staff were not to look at him or talk to him. Snoop dog was cool. He left a bunch of booze and weed behind in his suite. The house keepers got a bunch of top shelf hootch and weed after he left.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138712.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Eminem. I was in Denver once and I was waiting for an autograph with my little brother. It was really cold and we waited for like 3 or 4 hours. He just said no.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138715.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. My wife worked at a hotel for many years and met literally every major celebrity you can think of. She said Snoop was the coolest person she ever met and Bill Clinton was the biggest douche even though I find it hilarious. My wife was walking outside back into the hotel, saw Bill and stared until she smashed herself in the face with a tree branch. Bill started laughing so hard he was having a hard time standing. The secret service ran over to help her and Bill, laughing so hard he could barely talk, told them to leave her because they had to keep walking. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138716.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. My dad is a pilot and he frequently deals with celebrities. His company has all the staff sign NDAs, but my dad usually doesnt even know who the celebrities are unless theyve been in the news. He said that Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are incredibly rude to their own staff. Personal assistants were terrified of them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138717.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Tyra Banks. This takes place when UPN and WB were merging into “The CW”. She comes into town for an ANTM cattle call. Demands we repaint the office she was going to use, (for three days), makes our pregnant programming director cry, flips her shot and tries to get me fired when I wouldn’t get her a bottled water. My response was “have one of your people get it, I have to get back to the board, commercial break is up in 40 seconds.” Opposite side, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are two of the nicest celebrities I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. We had just gotten “that 70’s show” in syndication and they came out for promo shoots. Super friendly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138719.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. William Shatner said he would give me an autograph in Hawaii when I was about 10 . He said ‘lemme get a pen’, got in his limo and drove off.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138720.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Randy Jackson. He was invited to a telethon hosted by a hospital for children with severe disabilities, where my little sister lived until she passed away. Whenever the cameras were off, he would hide in his hotel room and seemed disgusted with the kids. Didn’t want anything to do with them. When the cameras were on though, he was all smiles and hugs. It was so disheartening and disappointed. Almost 10 years ago and I still remember it so clearly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138721.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I met Ed Westwick from Gossip Girl at Coachella.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I was an extra on X men: Days of Future Past. They were all nice. Jennifer Lawrence was the one that was the more meh with other people. I dont blame her too much... Peak hunger game popularity at the time I get it. She was probably afraid people would try to always give her too much attention...However the other actors didnt care about that. The NICEST ones by FAR were Hugh Jackman and James McAvoy for what I saw. For McAvoy, one of my friend was one of the extras right behind him in a scene and we were shooting 14 hours a day in cooking 40 degrees enclosed green screen bordered set in bright sunlight. We were running in high heels and wearing winter jackets... Basically a hellish day. And we couldnt sit anywhere! Well McAvoy saw my friend wasnt doing right and he let her sit in Professor Xs chair and have a bit of his water bottle. And with that said, the dude would just talk and chit chat with everybody, despite the very strict non-conversation with actors contract we signed. Hes just so chill.Hugh Jackman literally signed autographs in between shots and high fived a bunch of people all the time. Michael Fassbender told all set workers passing by him after a very long day of work battling in water to have a nice day. I was a huge fan of his at the time and it made my whole year at that point.F*ckin Peter Dinklage was dancing disco during the heatwave day to cheer people up.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138713.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I’ve worked as a maintenance worker at a concert venue for a few summers and have bumped into several celebrities, but Carrie Underwood is the one who sticks out because of how demanding she always was. She refused to use a toilet if someone else had sat on the seat before her — cleaning them was never good enough, so we had to buy new toilet seats every time she came. Considering how much we already had to fix, the last thing we wanted to do was pointlessly replace perfectly good toilet seats. In contrast, Reba McEntire would always eat lunch with the staff and was always super chill.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138723.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. I worked with Gwyneth Paltrows children for eight weeks at a camp, and we got paid $5 an hour. Parents usually tip $100 or more at the end, but she didnt tip at all.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138724.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Madonna! She comes to my job few times a year. And every time she comes shes comes with 5-7 other people wearing a big hat, sunglasses and tries to blend within her friends or whoever they are. The people she travels with are so needy and always have some sort of special request to ask for. No thanks no nothing when they leave no tip and also leave a big mess. Cant stand them. No hi and no bye. Im like bye b*tch. Besides that a lot of the other celebrities are nice!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138725.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. My daughter was at a store in orlando and ran into LeBron James when he was with the Heat. 13 yo girl asked for a pic and he got pissy, told her she wasnt worthy of a picture with him, did she even know who he was, he didnt have time for this. Walked away leaving her crying so bought her an ice cream.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138726.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. I met a lot of celebrities while working for an airline, one of them being Hugh Grant. One time, he sat in First Class 1A on a 747 (which is right in the nose of the plane), so there was nothing but a wall in front of the seat. Its standard procedure for the cabin manager to go around to every first-class passenger and personally introduce themselves. When my manager got to Hugh, the conversation went something like this: Manager: Hello, Mr. Grant, my name is... Hugh: Oh, F*CK OFF. My manager proceeded to swiftly move on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138727.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Im from Vancouver, Canada (big film industry town), and a close family member of mine has worked in film here for 20 years, so I have too many stories to list. How about some rude ones, and some nice ones. Gerard Butler. Around nine years ago he insistently pursued a friend of mine at a club/lounge. She wasnt interested and told him so. Instead of respecting her wishes, he approached us, her friends, and attempted to get her number from us without her knowing. He would not respect her boundaries, or respect that no means no. Dedee Pfeiffer (Michelle Pfeiffers sister) attempted to have my female family member (crew member) fired from the movie of the week they were working on because Dedee was threatened by my family members appearance. This is not hyperbole. A producer told my family member Shes threatened by you because youre a petite blonde, like her, and youre outgoing and popular with the other crew members. My family member wasnt fired; Dedee was presumably told to cool her jets and focus on her job. Dedee Pfeiffers ego really is, apparently, that delicate that she cant handle another woman around her having any kind of positive attention. Later on in the shoot Dedee was purging in a set toilet (she is bulimic) and her gag reflex wouldnt stop gagging, so she passed out and an ambulance was called. David Duchovny circa X-Files. Frequent hissy fits on set, flipping garbage cans over, etc. Probably contributed 90% of Vancouvers stripper and escort income during the shows run. John Travolta. Kind, professional man on set. Arrested while here filming Look Whos Talking in Stanley Park for soliciting sex from an undercover male VPD officer and discretely bailed out of jail at 2am by a producer.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138728.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Okay, so a quick disclaimer first - this wasnt me, but my friend Dolly who was a flight attendant for a well known British airline until she died. Shed been with them since year dot, and as a result of her seniority would work in the First Class cabin. In her own words, she preferred it at the front of the plane, the nylon carpets at the back played havoc with her bunions.. ANYWAY, One day she had a British celebrity called Katie Price onboard. Ms Price is famous for... umm.. having boobs and falling out of various bars, I think. So, Ms Price comes on board, spots Dolly, and proceeds to spend five minutes listing her demands for the flight - namely that she should have total privacy, that anyone coming near her should be escorted away, that no crew approach her unless she calls them, and that Dolly herself would be held responsible if she was bothered at all, heads would roll, etc..Dolly waited for her to finish her demands, and then said Certainly madam. And you are.......?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138718.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I’ve worked with Nicki Minaj before and while on a set with her, I was told not to look at her face. She also had people move out of the room before she would come in the room. It was a whole ordeal.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138729.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. When I was about 7 years old in the 70s, I was at the airport with my mom and her boyfriend and a friend of mine — my moms boyfriend told us that Evel Knievel was in one of the lounges. He was sitting in a back corner, drinking a glass of some kind of booze, and engulfed in a cloud of cigarette smoke. My friend and I approached him excitedly, and after he autographed some napkins, he looked at us and said, Before I give you these, Im going to teach you something. My friend and I looked at each other totally starstruck, and grinned like idiots. Evel proceeded to tap both of us on the arm and asked, Does that hurt? and we both shook our heads no — then he poked us lightly on the chest and asked, Does that hurt? and again, we both said no. Then he made fists out of both of his hands with the middle knuckles sticking out, and brought them down sharply and simultaneously onto both of our heads. Does that hurt? he asked, and neither of us could answer — I was holding back tears from the pain. He waited a few seconds and said, Thats why you wear a safety helmet, and then handed us the napkins.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138730.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. EASILY John Mayer and its not even close. If youve ever thought John Mayer was cool, know this; John Mayer is a whiney man-child that just wants to smoke weed and watch South Park and play Call of Duty all day. Met him at an awards show thing about 10 years ago. WOULD NOT STOP quoting some sexist joke from South Park. Everybody around was just laughing awkwardly because it was weird. Also every word out of his mouth was a sarcastic joke, but like a MEAN sarcastic joke about somebody that I was supposed to find funny. But they werent funny. They were just weird. And mean. Got mad at me and called me a butthead when I didnt laugh.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138731.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Peter Mayhew aka Chewbacca. I accompanied my friend to a comic-con, who’s hobbies include getting autographs and photos of celebrities.He was very short with us and didn’t care we were fans at all. He interrupts my friend in the middle of complimenting him for his work, stating the costs of a photo and an autograph. Fine. We ask if we can take a photo instead of one his photos he selling and he tells us we’ll still pay the full price of one of his photos. Also fine. As my friend goes to walk around the table to stand side by side, he shouts at us to stay on the other side of the table. So we try our best to not look insulted, and take a super awkward picture of an annoyed Mayhew and my friend trying to lean back to make it look like they are posing for a fan pic.We try to thank him right after but he brushes us off as soon as we hand him the cash. D*ck. In contrast, we met Margot Kidder aka Lois Lane. She was super nice and even let us take pictures pretending to be flying with her like in the movie! And it was her suggestion, too!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138732.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Tim Duncan - Former Basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs. I met him at a Walgreens Pharmacy in San Antonio. I was trying to get batteries but he was getting batteries too. He was in my way. So I said “excuse me, could I just get through really quick- ”He stopped me mind-sentence and said “Nah, I don’t take pictures. Just let me do what I gotta do.” “My bad. I’m just trying to-“. “Hey, look. I don’t want to take pictures right now so just stop. ”He left. I got my batteries.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138733.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Neil deGrasse Tyson. I worked at the bookstore in college, and would pick up extra shifts working late night events when I had time. NDT was giving a speech, and holding a little meet and greet afterwards. I signed up to run a table selling his books. After his speech, he comes in to the hall where Ive got my table set up. He comes over, introduces himself, and asks which of the 2 books I liked better of his. 20 year old me has no idea who is he and didnt read either book, so I replied I actually havent read either. Im just picking up an extra shift for the store. Well then he starts a 2 minutes rant, berating people my age for not being interested in science, didnt know who he was, blah blah blah. He finishes, I gave him a dumb blank stare, and he walked away. Talked down to me in a way that just made me feel like sh*t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138734.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Busta Rhymes came into the jersey shop I managed in Atlanta and got pissed off that I didn’t have a hat in his size. He called me a dumb f*ck - which hurt because I was a huge fan of his going way back to Leaders of the New School. Same store - Tyler Perry said he would “buy me and sell me” after I told him that the OnField 5950 Yankee hat was dark navy blue and not black - even though he demanded a “black Yankees hat like they wear on the field”. Snoop Dogg, Michael Vick, Terrell Owens (esp Terrell Owens, and Birdman were cool as f*ck.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138735.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Pierce Brosnan. Saw him loading his car up at a farmers market in Santa Monica. Walked up to him and told him I was a big fan. I didnt ask for a picture or anything. He got into his car and as he was backing up he told me to f*ck right off. Maybe I was in the wrong for walking up to him, I was just excited.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138736.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. I was in Las Vegas airport on a layover. I was reading Give Me the Damn Ball by Keyshawn Johnson. I was 14 or 15 at the time. Behind me at the airport convince store? Keyshawn Johnson. 14 year old me is super excited. He just signed with the Cowboys and I was a huge Dallas fan. I quietly said Im a big fan, and Im reading your book from behind big sunglasses he looks at me and says leave me the f*ck alone. I was crushed. In a moment of hate I screamed Its Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Keyshane Johnson and walked away. By contrast I watched a Packers/ Vikings game with Mike Ditka at JFK airport and he was awesome.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138737.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Samuel Jackson. Was walking around NYC around 17 or 18 and who do I see in the corner of my eye, but Mace Windu himself Kango hat and all. I was nervous about going up to him but I proceed to watch a young woman go up to him, show him her head shot, and take a picture with him. After he does this I have the confidence to strike so I stroll up and ask Are you Samuel Jackson? and he is like Nah so I proceed to ask Are you sure? Im pretty sure you are Samuel Jackson and he says Nah you got me confused with someone else and walks away. I was a massive fan before and now I will always associate him with that memory.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138739.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
