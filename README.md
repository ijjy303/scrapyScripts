## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">38 of the Most Soul-Crushing Things People Have Ever Heard</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. My husband and I took our teenage son and his friend (I’ll call him Alex) to an amusement park recently.

My husband is a really funny guy and was making both boys laugh on the car ride home.

Alex told my husband, “You’re really funny, Mr. D! You remind me of my Dad, except your jokes aren’t hurtful.”

My heart.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220880.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I used to work in a restaurant, and a woman came in with an urn and set it on her table. Apparently her son had died in a car accident very recently and she was supposed to take him out to lunch for his birthday… so she brought his ashes to lunch instead. She was there for a few hours sobbing into her food (we all felt so bad because people kept staring at her as we sat them or walked past her table). Then she ordered his favorite dessert off our menu with special birthday plating, and just let it sit on the table. It was really awful to watch her be so irreparably heartbroken.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220882.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. When I was 14, I overheard my mother, who had already abandoned my sister and was making arrangements for me to go live with a relative, trying to convince her new husband that they should have a baby together.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220884.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. My dad and step mom adopted a baby girl, and my step sister overheard my dad talking about how excited he is to adopt a girl because *he’s never had a daughter*.

Absolutely crushed my step sister, she thought of my dad like her own father. He’s been all she’s known.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220885.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I saw a documentary.... I dont even recall what it was about, but they were focusing on this family in a rural part of eastern Europe or southern Asia. There was a little girl in this family and all she did was work. She couldnt go to school, and she just assisted her mother in doing all the necessary drudgery around the house.

One of the film makers asked the girl what her secret dream was.

She said, To play.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220886.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Woken in the middle of the night to a phone call from an anonymous, kind nurse who said. “I regret to inform you but [your mother] passed away at 11:40pm. She was not alone... I held her hand.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220881.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. My first big break-up. I was crying and said to my mom, I feel like Im hard to love.

She gently replied, Well, you are.

I was the one being abused.

I was a typical teenager. Ive been brutally honest with multiple therapists (at first, on an attempt to get them to see whatever awful person my parents saw) and have been reassured a was a *typical depressed teenager*.

Any abusive behavior from me was reactive abuse (i.e. yelling after Id been pushed and pushed and pushed).

I wasnt the Proper Pastors Kid they wanted.

Ive been married to the same man for 15+ years (got married at 19) so... I found at least one person to love me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220887.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. My family just gave up on me.

-A 10-year-old that just got the news they had been unadopted by their family of the last 5 years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220888.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Son was moved from hospital to palliative care. They said he had about a week. After getting him settled there he stopped being alert so I went home to grab a shower and get some rest. He passed while I was away, alone.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220889.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Mom and Dad have been telling people they only have two kids from my sister. They have three kids. All because I didnt go to the religious college they wanted me to go to.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220890.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. My mum once told me “You wouldn’t be a very good mother, your sister would be much better”. I always loved and worked with children, my sister is more of an animal person. It crushed me because I always dreamed of being a mother and I still think about that comment made years ago when my boyfriend brings up the children topic.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220891.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Vleir is dead.

Vleir was the name of the pony who basically started my entire horse back riding experience, he gave me confidence like never before, he was so kind, so sweet, so gentle, he taught me how to canter, he taught me patience and how to jump. He was the best boy out there.

The last time I saw him was the afternoon of my usual riding lesson, he was sick so he wasnt being used for lessons. He passes away from a heart attack in his pasture that same night.

I remember crying myself to sleep the night my mom told me he was gone. Tearing up while writing this right now.

RIP Vleir sweet boy, I miss you and I regret not saying goodbye before I left to go home.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220892.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Walked into school one morning to find out one of my parents were dead.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220893.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Less what I heard and more what I saw. I found out my stepdad was cheating on my mom one day when I was 14. I waited a few hours for my mom to get home and when I showed her what I found she took a deep breath and walked outside into the driveway. I’ve never seen such a visible heart break and my own heart has never hurt so much for my mom. Thankfully now five years later they’ve worked through it but I don’t think my mom will ever be the same.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220894.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. “You’re going to end up just like your dad. A lonely junkie that no one wants to be around.” I just stood there silent. I didn’t know what to say to that.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220895.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Recently?

Dad called me a few weeks ago, Mom. Shes gone.

Shed been sick, but it was still pretty unexpected.

Still doesnt seem real.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220896.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. In the hospital 36 hours after having my first child my (then) husband said I was scaring him and I better get my s**t together because I was teary-eyed with happiness over my new little miracle baby.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220897.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. “He’s gone” 4 weeks after finding out my dad had cancer. I watched him die but hearing that destroyed me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220898.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. *I was only with you because x didnt want me, and now he does theres no future for us.*

Talk about a kick in the teeth.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220899.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. When my grandpa told me I wasn’t good enough. I was always never a girly girl but not quite a tomboy. I was really close to him but he was old school. As I grew up he started to realize that I wasn’t changing in the right way. He kept telling me to use my lady voice, to sit ladylike, eat lady like, and do ladylike things. He had enough when he saw me with my animals being not gentle when they were stubborn and getting dirty and liking it. He got mad and yelled at me after when no one was around. It hurt because always thought he would love me no matter what then I found out that there were conditions to his love.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220900.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. I had a close friend group and I left to go put something up. I came back and heard them say annoying so I of course asked who or what was annoying. They said you. me?, I said. Completely crushed me they also told me that. No one really likes me. Yeah that really did it and Im a lot different now. Im also kind of glad that happend because now Im a lot different.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220901.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Was told my best friend from primary school said this the day after we had to put my dog down, “She acts like he was going to live forever.” Doesn’t seem like much but it really upset me, considering I was like 9 or 10.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220902.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. My first kiss is a bad memory because the girl told me she lost a bet with her friends and was dared to do it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220903.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. I dont have time for you. My father said this to me multiple times when growing up.

<span style="font-size:4em">26. About five months into my relationship with my now-ex boyfriend, he pulled me aside from a conversation I was having with my mates. I was like whats up?

Nothing, I just dont know if I trust you around others anymore.
This guy was paranoid that I would leave him that he didnt want me having friends or going anywhere without constantly talking to him 24/7. He was even more worried because Im bisexual, meaning there was double the threat in his words.

That relationship went on for about 10 months, and about 5 months too long.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220906.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">32. An ex-girlfriend who left me allegedly because she wants to pay more attention to herself, self-development, does not want a relationship.

It would seem normal, at that moment I understood her, but after 2 days I found out that she had a new boyfriend. This blatant lie broke my heart...</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87220912.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">36. I lived on an Alaskan Island for a summer job, so lived with all coworkers, I was upstairs and I overheard everyone downstairs having a sort of conference about my snoring. People defending me against my roommate. Everyone on the island knew I snored because of her but she never talked to me so I could buy nasal strips or something….after that got tested turns out I have sever sleep apnea and now use a CPAP.
