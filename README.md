<span style="font-size:4em">3. D-Day was originally supposed to happen on 5th June but meteorologist James Stagg persuaded Dwight Eisenhower to postpone it by a day right at the last minute. The weather conditions had to be just right for the landings, and planners took the tide, wind speed and even the moon cycle into account.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/17/043907/87193942/dday1.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. The MV Derrycunihy, which was carrying troops to the D-Day landings, hit a mine before it could debark its troops and sank, killing more than 200 soldiers and sailors.

<span style="font-size:4em">5.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Bill Millin was a Scottish soldier who walked up and down the beaches of Normandy on D-Day playing the bagpipes. Two captured German snipers would later reveal why the piper at the front hadn’t been shot at. They said it was because they thought he was ‘dummkopf’, a foolhardy idiot.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/17/045104/87193965/dday22.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower had a speech prepared in the event that the 1944 D-Day invasion failed.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. During the D-Day invasion of Normandy by the allied forces, German commanders wanted to send the armored (Panzer Tanks) division to stop them. They had to wait for the order from Hitler because he was sleeping at the time and didnt want to be disturbed. When he woke up, it was too late.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/17/043959/87193951/dday11.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Among the thousands of men on the Normandy beaches on D-Day there was one single woman. Martha Gellhorn, a rogue war correspondent who stowed away in the toilet of a hospital ship and also happened to be the third wife of Ernest Hemingway.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/17/044004/87193952/dday12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. When practicing for the D-Day landings in Exercise Tiger at least 749 Americans were killed by friendly fire and a wolf pack of 6 German E-boats who stumbled on the LST ships in the dark. D-Day was nearly called off because 10 officers who knew the exact plans went missing.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/17/043948/87193949/dday8.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Of the 1,213 warships involved in D-Day, only 200 were American and 892 were British; of the 4,126 landing craft involved, 805 were American and 3,261 were British.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/17/044015/87193955/dday14.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. During the the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe (Battle of Normandy), From D-Day, June 6th to 21 August 1944, the Allies landed 2,052,299 men in northern France.

<span style="font-size:4em">17. British breweries donated free beer to soldiers during WWII, but after D-Day, there was no room for it on the ships going across the English Channel. Spitfire mechanics and pilots worked together to modify pylons to carry beer kegs and deliver brews to the troops. Flying high enough chilled it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/17/044024/87193959/dday16.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. British Cmdr Terence Otway, wanting to be sure his men wouldn’t leak the D-Day plans, tested them by sending 30 pretty members of the Women’s Aux. Air Force in civilian clothes to the local pubs with instructions to do all they could try and get the info, but none of the men fell for it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/17/044033/87193961/dday18.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. That in preparing for D-Day, the Allies fooled Germany into thinking that they would attack Pas de Calais instead of Normandy by creating a phantom army complete with fake landing crafts made from painted canvas and inflatable tanks which they moved overnight.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/17/044040/87193963/dday20.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">20 Most Controversial Takes On Star Wars</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. “For a show that explores the f**king universe, so much bullshit happens in goddamn Tatooine” - rocharox 

</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195135.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “Not enough planet wars, black hole wars or moon wars.” - BlueBerryMassacre</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195136.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “LASERS LOCK DOORS. LASERS OPEN DOORS. LASERS KNOW WHAT YOU WANT THE DOOR TO DO.” - SlamVanDamn</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195137.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “Han is actually older than Obi-Wan due to Time Dilation” - Snowbofreak</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195138.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “The Death Stars werent badly designed they were just badly managed.
Yes, designing them assuming large scale assaults was stupid given the political state of the galaxy but the second Death Star wasnt even finished so that doesnt count, its all Palpatines fault. As for the first one that was finished, the Alliance made three runs on the exhaust port. The first was called off before they made it to the trench, the second failed and the third was carried out by space Jesus which isnt exactly fair. All in all it sounds like a fairly effective defence when you consider the design philosophy.” - Engeneus</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195139.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “Not sure if controversial but they need to take the franchise and yeet it 200 years in the future. Im tired of the Empire era where they need to justify why more than 2 jedi and 2 sith exist at one moment along side knowing everything is pointless until Luke leaves the farm.” - Alandrus_sun</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195140.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “It is shown on multiple occasions that droids are very much alive with their own personality (C3PO, R2D2, L3,K-2SO, and more). Its clear robots are as alive in the Star Wars universe as any other alien race, yet they are treated worse than slaves by both the good and bad sides. C3PO and R2D2s memory being erased like its nothing, given away like slaves. Its quite hypocritical from the good side to treat droids like slaves yet be all goody two shoes about helping the flesh bodied creatures of the universe.” - wulfnstein85</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195141.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “That one of the biggest issues of Star Wars is that they keep going all in on Palpatine.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “I like Star Wars. The movies, the shows, the games. But the community ruins it. They complain and bitch about every single thing there is. It’s fantasy, not history..” - absoluteunit94</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195146.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “Return of the Jedi is my favorite SW film. Whenever someone says the words Star Wars my mind immediately goes to any particular scene in that movie. People say the movie is disjointed but every scene is memorable at the very least.” - SovietWalrus1</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195148.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. “In retrospect, it makes no sense that Obi-Wan and Yoda didnt train Leia alongside Luke and just left her as a backup. As one character recently said, shes just as important. In fact, Luke shouldnt have been the sole focus of the original trilogy. It shouldve been both of them.” - MegalodonDentistry</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195152.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
