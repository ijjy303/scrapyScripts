<span style="font-size:4em">4. Ive started reading a lot of forums of expecting mothers and mothers, and is terrifying to see how much pressure there is regarding birthing and motherhood: youll never be a proper mother if you have a c-section; you will never bond properly/be a good mother if you dont breastfeed; if you dont do X or Y or Z your child will be unhappy/unloved/will die and it will be your fault.And measuring a womans worth over the power of their vaginas: shame on you for doing IVF, there must be something wrong if you had only miscarriages, adopting is fine, but is the acceptance of failure, bio moms are best moms.-u/Kaliforniah</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176100.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Makeup and fashion fans bullying you for how you show your femininity and performing it not being your priority. If your makeup is not flawless and in trend, not okay. If you dont wear feminine, flattering clothes, not okay.-u/throwaway_thursday32</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176101.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. If you gave birth through c-section, youre not a real mom.What. The. F*ck? Suddenly 9 months of pregnancy, a terrifying procedure and caring for a newborn doesnt count because MacDuff from his mothers womb was untimely ripped?

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Shaming other girls/women for not doing/liking the same things you do and implying that their preferences make them not real women or similar.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Whatever is happening in Facebook birthing/mom groups. Some women are so out of touch with reality and high on toxic femininity that they think their uteruses are better than any doctor and that their feminine intuition supersedes any medical testing or intervention available today. Women are being brainwashed into skipping fetal testing and to avoid medical intervention even in life or death situations. It is literally killing mothers and babies and injuring a lot more.-u/no_ovaries_</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176105.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I see a lot of body-positive women that sh*t on my girlfriend for working out and keeping her body hairless. They always say she should be more loving of her body and embrace her body hair.It’s annoying. She does it cause SHE likes it. She goes to the gym and does deadlifts cause it empowers her and makes her feel AMAZING. Like, we all have different ideals and visions for our life. And after moisturizing herself and shaving she likes to rub her legs together like a cricket, and nobody should be taking that little slice of heaven from her.-u/Euowol</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176107.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Is it just me or is the term “Happy wife, happy life!” a little messed up?

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Believing that its a mans job to impress her when shes dating. F*ck that, if you like someone ACT AS THOUGH YOU LIKE THEM. Dating is an equal exchange of time and emotional labor, if she feels like she needs further financial compensation beyond that (paying for the food/show/whatever it is) then maybe she doesn’t like him enough.-u/BrainHurtingJuice129</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87176112.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Testing. This applies to testing their romantic partners just as much as their friends/family. Where they intentionally put someone in a situation that is rigged against them in order to judge them in some fashion based on their reaction.Im not claiming this is a feminine-only trait, but in my personal experience Ive seen it come from women much more than men.My sisters friend recently gave her permission to pursue a guy they were mutually attracted to. My sister did, and it turned out that the friend was only testing to see if my sister was a real friend or not.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “People on the internet really seem to buy into the idea that elephants find humans cute. The source of this is a tumblr post that claims the same region of the brain thats active when humans see puppies is what lights up when elephants see us. But that requires MRI machines big enough to accommodate elephants, as well as keeping an animal that weighs like 5 tons still whilst its fully conscious. It also means assuming that the brain structures do the same job across species.

If anything, the harsh reality is that wild elephants probably see humans as threats, given that as a species were actively doing our best to kill them. Elephants who live in zoos or sanctuaries may be endeared to their keepers and thus humans in general, however. The good news is that this can probably change if poaching is ever stopped. Elephants whod been raised in the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, for example, have led sick or injured herd-mates back to the sanctuary for treatment.” -ButterflyOfDeath</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174571.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
