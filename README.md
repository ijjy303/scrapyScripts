## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">Nic Cage Gets Candid Answering the Internet's Burning Questions</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Q - Who is your favorite character in all of literature and film? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/043143/87144050/east-of-eden.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

A - That is so hard to answer. I will say that James Dean’s performance as Cal in East of Eden is largely the reason I became a film actor. His role in that is one of my favorite characters in cinema. But then we can go all the way to Rasputin or we can go to Dmitri Karamazov. Dmitri Karamazov is one my favorite characters in literature. I love him so much because he’s so happy and he has no money. He’s just living it up. He spent all his money trying to get the girl. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/043715/87144052/download.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">


I did the same thing once. I was very Dmitri Karamazov in high school. The most beautiful girl in high school who was a grade older than me invited me to the prom but I had no money. My grandmother gave each of us a little bond. My older brother bought a car. My second oldest brother bought some stereo equipment. And I splashed out on a chauffeur-driven limousine, a tuxedo and a four course meal at Le Dome on Sunset blvd. The car was $2000, the stereo was $2000, and my prom night was $2000 and man, that was money well spent. THAT’s Dmitri Karamazov.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/043835/87144053/34017122-8807887-image-m-131_1601929849363.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Q: I have a 2 regarding the movie Willys Wonderland. Did you or the director decide that you would not say a single word the whole movie, and 2, every time you went to recharge (grab a can from 6 pack) was it secretly filled with alcohol or anything like that? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044016/87144055/image.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

A: The dialogue for my character in Willy’s Wonderland was very sparse, so I decided with Kevin, the director, to go full Harpo Marx and take all the dialogue out because I thought that would be a fun acting challenge to see how much I could communicate without words and only with movement and facial expressions. I’m very happy with the results of Willy’s Wonderland. It was a good experiment. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044156/87144056/the_unbearable_weight_of_massive_talent_229253.0.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

The can question is an interesting one, and I hesitate to answer it for you because your relationship with the movie is far more important than my relationship with the movie and so you as the audience member can imagine and surmise whatever you want to be in that can. That is a far better answer and reason for the can than anything I could tell you. I want YOUR opinion as to what was in the can, because that was the right opinion.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044416/87144058/merlin_190797741_3bd42c19-5686-46c9-b90d-99f6c84d2c13-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Q: You and Pedro seemed like you had so much fun making this movie; what is one story you don’t mind sharing that you haven’t yet about your experience with filming and working with Pedro? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044521/87144059/EB20040425REVIEWS08404250302AR.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: First and foremost, Pedro Pascal is a genuinely nice man. You couldn’t ask for a nicer more pleasant person to work with. Second, he has a very unique sense of humor. It’s the kind of sense of humor where I don’t know if he’s really making a joke or he isn’t making a joke. Such as comment about the appearance of a cabbage in a cabbage field. And it made me wonder if he was a method actor and was in character and adding a kind of confused dimension to the Javi role, or if he genuinely thought the cabbage was amusing. I am still confounded by this. I mean who makes a joke about cabbage, except him? It’s just not funny!

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Q: What has been your most challenging role to get into character each day to film? What is your favorite character that youve ever portrayed? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044732/87144065/1498576162376-cage12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: I would say that Nick Cage in Massive Talent was the most challenging role I had to get into character for because I had the added component of trying to protect a person named Nick Cage and also facilitating the director’s absurdist vision of so-called Nick Cage and it was a highwire act every day. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044931/87144066/343423131441.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

Again, Pig is my favorite performance of mine, and I think that movie, along with Scorsese’s Bringing Out The Dead are arguably my two best movies as a whole</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045052/87144067/MV5BMTMzNzA0MTUzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEyNzkwNQ@@._V1_.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Q: I know you have a love of the silent era, especially the German expressionist stuff. What’s your favorite silent film? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045208/87144068/52744-posts.facebook_lg.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: Boy that’s a hard list to conjure up because there are so many memorable ones but I would say that Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera comes to mind but Nosferatu, Schreck, his performance, and even Barrymore in Jekyll and Hyde. I think that Barrymore did more to inspire Schreck’s performance than the other way around. Oh, and anything Chaplin did was magic: City Lights, Modern Times. It depends on the season!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045410/87144069/05a.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Q: Pig was an absolutely incredible film, what drew you to that project, and why do you think that it struck a cord with so many people? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045541/87144092/1308201.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

A: Thank you. I was interested in returning to a more quiet, naturalistic style of film performance, having done a series of more operatic performance styles. The movie feels rather like a folk song to me or a poem, and the character of Rob was contending with tremendous grief and self imposed isolation and I think we as a group of people experiencing a pandemic in 2020-21 we’re probably also having similar feelings of loss and isolation and it communicated to a nerve we were all experiencing. Its one of my favorite movies, and its probably my best work.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045655/87144093/wild-at-heart-slide-1.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Q: Have you seen Leaving Las Vegas recently? I think that is my all time favorite Nicolas Cage performance. How do you feel thinking back on Leaving Las Vegas and your performance in it? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045942/87144094/types-of-pasta-1581024990.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: Thank you. I think Leaving Las Vegas, Pig and Bringing Out The Dead are my three favorite performances of my own body of work. I have not seen Leaving Las Vegas recently, however that movie and Elizabeth Shue’s work in that movie are what I aspire to continue towards, and did continue towards with Pig, which is why I am always going to be up for small budget, independent, dramas.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/050203/87144095/1500386626-credit-melinda-sue-gordon.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Q: Ethan Hawke said that youre the first actor since Marlon Brando to do something new with the art of acting. Any thoughts on that? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/050341/87144096/nationaltreasure_niccage1.gif" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: It’s very kind of Ethan to say so, as you may well know, I’ve worked with Ethan in Lord of War and have always been spellbound by his talent. I think many of the choices I’ve made have been inspired by film stars from the silent era as well as cultural expression of performance like Kabuki and some of the Golden Age actors like Cagney so I don’t know how to say I’ve done something new because those elements are always on my mind

## <a href="#linky12" id="linky11">30 Trashy Things People Have Seen At Weddings</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I was actually the bartender but it was a hoot. 1st, wedding was outside and it stormed violently. Groom was hammered pre wedding. Hit on all the bartenders. Then the DJ got hammered, made lewd comments to women in the microphone. Then basically everyone was hammered, knocked over the wedding cake which also happened to be a table with many candles, so the place caught on fire. Good times. Often wonder how that marriage worked out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143683.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. The best man screwed the grooms mother between the meal and the dancing. The groom finds out and punches the best man, breaking his hand. The best man drives away and gets stopped by the police for drunk driving.

Being a wedding photographer is awesome.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143682.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Camo print wedding dress that was borderline see-through. Walked down the aisle to the Scooby Doo theme. No, nobody knows why they chose that song, including the couple themselves. They divorced a few months later after they both stopped cleaning the house in an act of defiance against one another.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143684.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. My own. In a Mississippi judges office with a bag of Cheetos on her desk. She wiped her hands on a napkin, grabbed a Bible, and did her thing with orange crumbs on her lips. Her work heels were not on because she was in her office. It was extremely rush. I understand that she was on her break but we didnt mind waiting. Idk why they rushed us thru.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143685.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. A wedding where they had a flag that said “I had my wedding on Friday because Saturdays are for the boys”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143686.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The mother in law took a swing at the bride on the dance floor. Still blows my mind thinking about it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143687.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. A wedding on the beach behind Hooters. The officiant stood next to a trash bin. As if it was planned, the trash collector pulled up during the vows. Did he wait to change the bag? Absolutely not. Children at the wedding swarmed the couple like the flies around the trash can just after the kiss, stepping all over her dress. She bent over to adjust her sandal and a pack of Marlboro reds fell out of the bust along with her right breast.

It felt like we were rubber necking instead witnessing a marriage.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143688.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I don’t even know where to begin.. ceremony was comprised of immediate family then followed by a reception with all guests in a relatively nice hotel banquet hall. An hour in at 7pm the open bar was completely closed down because MULTIPLE guests were throwing up in the bathroom sinks causing flooding, the groom was so wasted even before the ceremony but was blackout by the time of reception. During the first dance he kept his hands in his cargo pant khakis the entire time and ate dinner sitting on the floor in a corner of the hall while the bride sat at the head table alone. About two hours in, the groom randomly left and slept at their house while the bride stayed in the newlywed suite by herself.. they are now separated as you may have assumed by this point.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143689.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Grooms best man went around with a naked photo of the groom. Showed everyone including the bride and grooms family. The worst part was there were kids at the wedding including the brides very young son and it wasnt a small photo either like on his phone it was a huge canvas of the groom nude.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143690.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I used to work at a place that had a very large tent-like building that was often used for weddings, receptions, celebration of life events, etc. It was on a local lake in a beautiful area. It was very expensive to rent out ($3,000-$5,000 depending on how much work from staff is required). Well one family rented it out for the trashiest wedding I had encountered there.

The wedding was peacock themed and the decorations consisted of black and teal paper plates, random peacock feathers, and teal paper cups. They wanted to put all this stuff out the night before the wedding. The owner warned them that this is basically a tent on the lake and things left out will get dirty and spider webbed overnight. They ignored this advice and then pitched a fit when they returned the next morning.

Next, the bride had neglected to try her dress on since she purchased it and had gained weight. She couldnt zip it. She ended up buying a white tank top to wear under it and left it unzipped.

Then after the ceremony, everyone was very inebriated and the brides mother set up a chair on the middle of the dance floor had the groom sit there and cheered her daughter on as the bride gave the groom a very very vigorous lap dance.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143691.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Wedding was in a suburban driveway. The maid of honour stole the bouquet from someone’s garden and the best man proudly announced he had shoplifted the rings. The groom wore a button-down shirt that said ‘f**k off’ in fancy lettering. The bride stopped in the middle of the vows to tell her mother to ‘get that [friggin] kid out of here.’ It was her second kid by the previous bloke.

When it was over, we apologized to the celebrant. He said he’d seen worse.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143692.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. A friend of the family is a wedding photographer. We went to dinner with her family a few weeks ago and she explained the most bizarre wedding she had ever been to (which happened to be that same day, and involved someone we all know)

Wedding was behind a trailer in a trailer park

Folding chairs clearly labeled Property of [school], there were two church pews, and several 5 gallon buckets turned upside down

Some of the wedding party arrived on riding mowers

The bride was wearing some screen-printed t-shirt, jeans, and a veil made from cheesecloth

The groom was wearing a jean vest with no shirt underneath and torn jeans

The bride had met the groom just over 3 months prior, as the groom was still married to his 1st wife at the time. Divorce takes 90 days here. Do the math.

Most of the guests were dressed like they were in the middle of doing yard work

Reception was in the same area. Several cases of PBR and Miller Lite, supermarket pre-boxed cheese and cracker spreads, and a few Bojangles fried chicken boxes</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143693.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. A family member of mines 2ND wedding reception was held INSIDE a indoor gun range. The groom was obviously an avid hunter because the entire wedding party was wearing camouflage suits and the bonus was the open bar consisting on two kegs of coors light sitting trash cans filled with ice.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143694.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Both of my middle sisters weddings.

Dont get me wrong, shes the sane one of my sisters and I actually really love her, but she has a, shall we say, unique sense of style.

Wedding #1 was while she was working as a carnie, and was held after closing time on the midway at some podunk county fair. I may well have been the only sober person there, and there were definitely more tattoos than teeth in attendance. She wound up leaving him when he turned out to be an abusive self-centered twat who contributed nothing to taking care of their kid.

Wedding #2 (just last year) was mostly okay, and BIL is a really stand-up guy. But yall, the whole wedding theme was camo. My sister wore a camouflage wedding dress and matching crocs. BIL wore jeans and a dress shirt with a camo vest. The frigging cake was covered in camo-patterned ribbons and IDK where the hell she got camo patterned silk roses but the cake had a pile of those too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143695.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Ceremony was in a park - not booked or decorated, just showed up and found a spot.

Reception was at a scout hall. No decorations again, and for catering the brides family went through Red Rooster drive thru and got a bunch of whole chickens and chips. Like, 5 different cars went through one after the other and ordered, they didnt even pre order.

Groom and all his friends were high as kites and only reason bride wasnt is because she announced she was knocked up.

Groom and his mates bought their dirt bikes and after eating went out and rode them around the hall. Was so loud and muddy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143696.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. The bride made a speech thanking her in laws for financial assistance for the event. Her mother was not thanked and she was furious. There was a long head table for bridal party and parents. It was made out of small tables pushed together covered by one long tablecloth. The mother pulled a small table out of the arrangement, catching the table cloth, and nearly destroying the head table set up. Now the bride got angry and there was much back and forth with various family members attempting to make peace. The mother refused to push back her table and began to invite others to sit with her, all people who were not meant to be seated at the front. Mother of bride continued to sit there and talk s**t about her daughter, the bride, to anyone who would listen.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143697.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. The bride and her sisters did a strip tease/lap dance on the groom immediately following dinner. In front of his grandmother.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143698.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. My friend group and I talk about this wedding to this day, and probably will for the rest of our lives. The bride and groom decided to do things on a very, very small budget. Thats fine! Frugal weddings and budget weddings can be beautiful and nice! There is a difference between a frugal wedding and a cheap wedding, however, and this was cheap. For instance:

- The wedding was in July. They decided to hold it in a non-air conditioned park shelter.

- The decorations were actual trash. The bride decided me and the other bridesmaids needed tiny top hats, which she made from discarded styrofoam cups. Mine had ants in it.

- She asked me to be the MOH. I was flattered but confused. Shed had three MOHs before me, and they all quit for various reasons, mostly baby daddy drama related.

- She wanted live music but wouldnt pay a pianist. My friend Stephens sister said shed play the wedding march on a keyboard for 50 bucks. Said sister couldnt actually play the piano, but she did the prerecorded wedding march song. Nobody could tell the difference because the woman in charge of baking the cake got [drunk] the day before and was baking the cake in the non-air conditioned park shelters little kitchen while listening to the radio. Very loudly.

- The bride and groom tried to write their own vows, got in a fight over it, and didnt tell the officiant until the day of that there were no vows. Fortunately, he was on it and had backup vows ready to go.

- The bride hadnt tried on her dress, which shed bought from aliexpress, until the day of. It was way too small and we had to rip out the back and safety-pin in some satiny white fabric... which would have been great, if the dress hadnt been off-white. The groom made comments and it turned out that the whole dress thing was based on his mom offering to pay for the dress, then rescinding because she had to bail out his brother. My friend, instead of going to an actual store and buying a dress, picked one off of aliexpress.

This would have been less weird if I hadnt been dress shopping with her like, three times because her mom couldnt/wouldnt pick out a mother of the bride dress.

- The grooms ENTIRE FAMILY including his best man and his two groomsmen left right after the meal (spaghetti, green beans, and McDonalds orange drink) was served. The DJ (my friend Stephen and his Bose speakers) didnt know this and tried to announce the grooms dance with his mom... his mom had left. Apparently his family was furious that it was a dry venue. The only member of the family left was the ring bearer... who it turns out was forgotten. We had to take him home because his family wouldnt come get him.

- The groom slept through the rehearsal and showed up to the wedding drunk.

- We had to put another friend on bouncer duty because two of the brides aunts tried to walk away with the cash envelope. We gave him the envelope because he was the tallest and we figured he could outrun the aunts.

- The brides brother was originally on envelope duty but we caught him taking a 50 out of the envelope, so we had to take it from him.

- We had to politely inform the best man he couldnt smoke in the portajohn.

- We had portajohns instead of actual working bathrooms.

The worst, though, was the photographer. As MOH, I was informed day of that I had to keep the photographer 100 feet away from the ring bearer and flower girls at all times. He was a registered sex offender, but also the brides uncle, and he volunteered to do the pictures for free, so... he ended up using a telephoto lens. Because he couldnt get close enough to the wedding party to take the pictures.

They divorced a couple months later after the house they were staying in burned to the ground. I have no idea to this day why they even got married.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143681.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. It was at a Holiday Inn, the groomsmen all were brightly colored prom vests and jeans. I was a +1 to one of the bridesmaids, I just wore a regular suit, nothing fancy. I was still dressed better than the groom and I got dirty looks for it</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143699.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. I worked at a high-end golf club in Seattle that held extravagant weddings on a regular basis. This wedding in Samoa is perhaps my favourite:

-All of the guys wore lime green vests and snapbacks that matched.

-As mentioned in the contract, the wedding party must order food from the golf clubs restaurant. Instead, they order Dominos, and the pizza delivery man serves them pizza while they sit in a beautiful restaurant.

-Right before the marriage, the bride and broom groom had a fistfight, which caused the ceremony to be postponed until bruises could be concealed with cosmetics.

-A live band was engaged to perform at the event, but they were not fed. The lead vocalist decides to speed down the hill during their first break to fetch a drink.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143700.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. There were no tables and chairs. Like none. They had an open bar but no chairs. Everyone had to put their drink on the ground and hold their plate to eat. It was crazy.

Everyone just assumed that some sort of terrible thing happened where the tables and chair people didnt bring them but afterwards I asked her (the bride) what happened and she just said Oh we would have had to pay extra for that.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143701.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. A friends wedding. She was walking down the aisle and had to pause to put out her cigarette. It was a small wedding and her friends thought it was hilarious. Married less than 2 years. She married him because he was in the military and she thought she was getting cash for life. He chose deployment to a war zone over staying with her.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143702.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. I had one of my friends from highschool get married in a trashy way. His fiancé at the time invited him to lunch at Buffalo wild wings and she had also invited the whole family (they where in on it) and once my friend showed up he found out it was a surprises wedding (just like you would do a surprise birthday party) The even trashier part is they didnt like reserve the restaurant or anything so in his wedding photos (standing in front of the bathrooms by the way) you can see complete strangers coming out of the bathrooms.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143703.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. a coworker of mine got married in her driveway. on the invitation it said that everyone had to wear the color purple and they served KFC and hostess cupcakes for dessert. music was a boom box with the local light rock station playing. the worst part was that she let her dogs crap all over the driveway during the reception so no one ever picked up the poop. we all just kinda weirdly hopped around it in our variety of purple hues.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143704.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Half Mormon half not Mormon wedding. The Mormon half was ultra Mormon, the non-Mormon half was a good amount recovering addicts. The mother got her daughters attention by just standing in front of whatever she was looking at including the groom, the photographer, the DJ, didn’t matter. Mom was also pretty high most of the wedding. 22 people in the bridal party, only 2 girls were the brides bridesmaids from before she met the Mormons. They kept getting frustrated because the Mormon bridesmaids kept pulling the bride away from them whenever they saw them all together alone. No alcohol served so the non-Mormon side went to the liquor store across the street and served their own. Cake smash fail, went straight into the bride’s hair. Mormon side started to talk crap about the drinkers and so the drinkers tried to pick fights with the Mormons. Wedding ended early, lots of tears. Such a hot mess wedding. The couple are both dentists.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143705.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. I went to a wedding in a funeral home once. Drove by it three times before realizing that is was in fact the correct address for the venue. Reception and ceremony were there.. completely dry wedding too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143706.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. I went to a wedding that had a Matrix theme. The groomsmen all wore floor length leather jackets and tiny sunglasses. The MC made a slideshow of images from the movie with the groomsmen’s faces badly photoshopped on. They insisted on calling each other “Neo” and “Amorpheous” while high-fiving each other. It was painful.

There was a lot of tension at the wedding and it turned out that the groom had cheated on the bride a few weeks earlier but she had still decided to marry him. His family was really trashy and took the view that their son had cheated because the bride wasn’t good enough for him. The bride’s family was not trashy but pissed that she took him back and obviously hated the groom and his [lousy] family. The sister was the maid of honour and her speech was very sarcastic “just so glad to welcome you to the family… Greg” but it went over the head’s of the groom’s relatives. Everyone who knew the story was cringing.

The groom’s Dad was loaded. He stood up and told a long and convoluted story about a wife giving teaspoons of sugar to God which made no sense and seemed to have very sexist undertones. They cut quickly to the music and the drunk groom’s father hit the dance floor and started grinding with some woman who wasn’t his wife. His wife sees and has a s**t fit and starts screaming at him. They won’t stop fighting so they cut the music and have the four piece, high school band play classical music badly. It includes a squeaky clarinet.

Like a terrible foreshadowing from above, it starts pissing with rain and people start trying to politely leave. Last thing I see, is the groomsmen running to their cars with their trench coats folded up over their heads to protect their tiny sunglasses, while the band plays the squeaky Matrix theme song. It was amazing.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143707.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. The bride had a little too much to drink. She was on her hands and knees throwing up on the front lawn of the reception hall while people were arriving.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143708.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. I got married at a drive through in Las Vegas. The only photo I still had my seat belt on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143709.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. Im so glad I can share this story again.

In my early 20s a childhood friends sister was getting married. I was friendly with the family and all the siblings so I agreed to go. When I got the invitation it said on the invitation no gifts please just money. This didnt seem like the bride. She would be fine with either. I then get contacted by brides mother who tells me to get them a physical gift because the grooms mother is planning on taking any money they get as compensation for planning the wedding.

I get to the venue which is a church but the wedding is not actually in the main part of the church. It is in the church basement. So bizarre. It looks like the set up of a high school dance. My friend whos sister is getting married tells me that her sister never got her dress altered so they had to use safety pins. They walk down the aisle to a Metallica song playing on a boom box.

The ceremony was quick thankfully. No alcohol at the wedding. Ok, it is what it is. There was sparkling 99 cent grape juice at each table. I know it was 99 cents because the stickers were left on the bottles. Brides mother comes over to me and said I wouldnt eat the food. It was actually food that was supposed to be for meals on wheels and some of it was frozen leftovers of food that wasnt used. This was the grooms mothers idea since she was paying for the wedding.

I gave the bride and groom my gift. They said thank you and seemed perfectly happy with getting a physical gift. Grooms mother comes over to me and asks me why I didnt get them cash or a check for a gift. That it said that right on the invitation. I played dumb and said I must have missed that. She was pissed.

Lastly there was a guy there who took a liking to me. He was dressed in a white tank top, backwards hat and sweatpants. You know, some proper wedding attire... He told me he just got out of jail for drugs and that the bloods and the crips wanted him in their gangs. I told him thats interesting because hes white and I thought they didnt usually recruit white guys. He said they just really wanted him and that he hung out with black people all the time. He then told me that you could cure AIDS by injecting dish soap. It cleans out the blood. He asked for my phone number. I declined. Shockingly the marriage only lasted a few years. Groom has full custody of their two kids because bride is not capable of taking care of their children. She had social services called on her multiple times.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143710.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Going on road trips as a kid where the only form of entertainment was some sort of game played amongst your siblings in the back seat involving the license plates of other passing cars. On our car trip to Disney/FL from central PA me and my brother had a competition on who could write down the most license plate numbers… we ended in the thousands but for the life of me I can’t remember who “won” </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87143618.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Clackers. They were colorful glass (yes glass) balls at the ends of a piece of rope with a ring in the middle to put your finger through.

They were eventually taken off the market since the glass balls could shatter and kids were getting injured by the flying glass shards. They were a big fad toy for a while there. They came back later with plastic balls.-u/lanky_planky</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87143620.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. How much time we spent playing outside, but not in organized sports. Pickup kickball in the street where you yell “CAR!” to break up the game briefly for a car driving through. Coming home covered in dirt after disappearing for five hours. We all made fun of how we were called by our parents. We would explore and poke around. Dig up worms, chase butterflies, freak out over finding a dead baby bird, skin our knees at least twice a summer and entertain ourselves for hours.-u/GoddessOfOddness</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87143621.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
