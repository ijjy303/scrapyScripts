<span style="font-size:4em">1. They broke our one TV and didnt pay for a replacement. My family has always been dirt poor and my mom busted her butt to buy that stupid TV, too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87195576.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Everyone has a story from their childhood that still pisses them off, this is mine.
I was five years old and my snotty older cousin was over at our house. I had just gotten a copy of Mike Tyson’s Punch out for my birthday. He was getting his butt kicked by king hippo and he got so angry he rage quit. But he didn’t just rage quit, he ripped the cartridge out of the Nintendo and spit into it. Then he threw it across the room and stormed out.

<span style="font-size:4em">
I told my parents what happened and they told his parents and they made him apologize, but the game was ruined. It would kind of play, but would freeze up all the time. My family barely had enough money to get me the game for my birthday never mind buying it again. I was sure I would never be able to play it again.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Then for Christmas this little brat got Mike Tyson’s Punch Out. So my older brother went over to his house and switched our ruined cartridge with his. It was awesome.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87195570.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. My in-laws hated me. We invited them over for thanksgiving dinner and, upon arrival, they asked me to leave and come back a few hours later because they wanted to “follow their tradition of preparing the meal alone as a family.” They are now my ex-in-laws.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87195598.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I had just moved into a new house. I invited my one friend over for celebratory drinks cause hey, I just got a house. Things were going great, we were tipsy and having fun. My boyfriend was coming home so I made her a bed on my pull out couch. Boyfriend came home and we all went to bed. Around 2 am he heard rustling around, he thought nothing of it. He just assumed she was drunk and playing with the cats. I woke up around 4am and got a bad feeling and woke up my boyfriend.

<span style="font-size:4em">
We went upstairs and noticed the bed hadn’t even been touched. Pillows and blankets still folded. I turned the lights on and noticed my front door was open and all the cats were gone. Further more into looking around we noticed his wallet was open and over a $100 in money had been taken out, our change bowl was empty and his Xbox and brand new elite Xbox controller was gone, as well as my laptop. She stole his medicinal marijuana and broke glasses .I called her freaking out and she said “I left cause I didn’t want to hear you doing it (which we never had) and she let my cat out to run away because she didn’t like cats. She then proceeded to say my partner was a jerk who was cheating on me (she had never met him until that night).

<span style="font-size:4em">
We called the cops. She denied stealing anything. I messaged her fiancé saying what she had done and what she had stolen, he messaged me text screenshots of her asking how much she could get for his Xbox and Xbox elite controller, thus proving she did steal it. Sent all these screenshots to the cops and they went to her house a couple times and eventually find her hiding in there not answering the door on purpose. She got charged with petty theft and they found out she committed fraud against her fiancé and her dad. It was a total nightmare.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87195575.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I was a kid probably 9 or 10 and my mom had a friend and her son over for lunch. The kid disappeared for about 10 minutes, and at the time I thought he had gone to the bathroom cause i really had to go. So when he came back I quickly maneuvered my way past him into the room before the bathroom, where we had a fish tank. This would be completely irrelevant if the fish tank wasnt cloudy and swirling about. At first glance I didnt know what it was until I noticed smashed and ripped apart pieces of little fish faces moving around in the swirl. The kid reached into the fish tank and squeezed the ever loving life out of every single fish in that tank.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87195581.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I’m pissed just typing this even though it has been years. Some of my wife’s family came to visit. The idea was that on their way to the Smokey mountains they would stop and visit with us for a day or two since we seldom see each other and our house is on the way. Turns out that was total BS, they just wanted to use our house as a free hotel. Which, to a degree, is fine. I don’t mind lending a room to a family member.

<span style="font-size:4em">
But they were not even remotely cool about it. First, they called and asked if we could have something for them to eat because it would be late when they arrived and had no time to stop. So I decided I would make a lasagna since I’m kind of known for that in the family. So I spent like $60 and several hours to make two big pans of lasagna since it would have to feed several people. They showed up with chic-fil-a bags and said they had already eaten.

Then they went immediately to their rooms upstairs, not to sleep but to watch TV (which is in the bedroom) without hardly saying a thing to us besides “hi hows it going”. Then in the middle of the night one of them got cold and turned the thermostat up to like 77 degrees which means the heater ran non stop for hours and hours and we woke up damn near in a sweat. When they woke up they asked if I normally cook breakfast. I said no, not on weekdays because I have to go to work. They gave dejected looks so I was like, fine, I can make breakfast. Would you guys like waffles or eggs and bacon? They said eggs so I made a metric ton of eggs and bacon and left it for them because I had to go to work.

When I got home they hadn’t even touched the food I made, the kitchen was an absolute disaster because they decided they wanted waffles instead and helped themselves, without even asking, dirtying every damn dish in the house and ruining my waffle iron because they left it on until it auto shut off but by then had burned the batter until it was fused to the thing and the whole house reeked of burnt waffles for two days. They also clearly scratched my wife’s car as they left because it was in the driveway and coincidentally had huge scratch where maroon paint had rubbed off and guess what color their van was. I asked them about it and they said they had no idea how it got there.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87195588.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

My mum attempted to hold piano classes in our house once, and there was this one time when a mum and her young (like 7 years old) daughter came for an inquiry. All the time the mum and my mum were standing and talking, and the daughter was walking around touching everything, opening all the containers, looking in, playing with things... And the mum acted like she didnt see a thing. The daughter opened a container above our piano, and pulled out sheets of stickers. MY stickers. She really liked them and turned around to ask her mum, Mum, can I take these?

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch when he said something like “I want cool people to wear our clothes, not fat people” when asked why they didn’t carry any plus sized clothes for women. The term “cancelled” wasn’t really a thing back in 2013 but man did A&F get cancelled HARD after that</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199075.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. My grandpa. For 23 years of my life, I thought he was the most honest and upstanding person I had the honour of knowing. Then last year, I found out he’s always had a habit of manipulating his dying family member’s/friend’s wills into leaving him and his wife the good, expensive stuff (houses, cars, etc). It’s how he’s avoided bankruptcy for so damn long. Selling off these stolen houses to pay for his own. He stole a house out from his own step daughter after her son had been in a near fatal accident, and she herself had just survived a suicide attempt. So yeah. Turns out the best man I know is one of the worst. And what’s better? He passed on his house stealing skills to his cvnt daughter (my aunt). So the cycle continues. Ugh. Sorry for the rant.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199078.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Travis Scott’s apology and behavior during the Astroworld tragedy. Dude is an awful person and people just give him a pass because he’s rich and famous and is married to one of the Kardashian relatives. Ppl pick and choose man I swear. They will blindly defend people if they like them enough. Dude basically let 10 people die.

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Gerald Ratner

at one time Ratners were a nationwide chain of jewelry shops in the UK, they were known as an affordable jewelry shop.

In 1991 he was a guest at the Institute of Directors and made a speech where he called the stuff sold by his shops, total C**p. A popular range of earrings was described as being cheaper than a prawn sandwich and compounded it by saying the prawn sandwich would last longer.

shares in the company dropped like a stone and he was fired by the majority company shareholders</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199083.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. There was a PC building company earlier this year that disqualified a prize winner because the company owner thought the winners social media presence was too weak.

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Former Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers baseball player and executive Al Campanis.

He had a brief career as a player with the Brooklyn Dodgers, playing only 7 games with them in 1943, but spent a lot of time in the minor leagues and played one season in the minors with Jackie Robinson the year before Robinson became the first African-American player in the majors. After retiring as a player he became a scout and moved up in the organization to become the General Manager of the Dodgers in 1968.

On April 6, 1987 Campanis was invited to appear on the TV show *Nightline* to be interviewed by Ted Koppel about Jackie Robinson, as April 15th would be the 40th anniversary of Jackie Robinsons first game in the majors and they were good friends until Robinsons death in 1972.

Koppel asked Campanis about why there were so few Black managers and no Black general managers. Campanis answered, I truly believe that they may not have some of the necessities to be, lets say, a field manager, or, perhaps, a general manager. When pressed later in the interview by Koppel, he said Why are Black men or Black people not good swimmers? Because they dont have the buoyancy and also saying that the Black race certainly are short on individuals with strong decision-making capabilities.

He was fired from the Dodgers less than two days later and never worked in baseball again, passing away in 1998.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199090.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. The PR chick traveling to South Africa who tweeted something like, heading to Africa, hope I dont get AIDS. Just kidding, Im white!

Turned her phone off for the flight, and by the time she turned it on when she landed, it had gone viral and, if memory serves, she had already lost her job.

Edit: Quite a few people commenting that she must be awful at her job and/or she should have known better.
1. in the earlier days of social media, it was reasonably expected that your posts would remain private among your network. This is one of the first cases of a non-celebrity post going viral and being publicly shamed for it. There was no precedent. Bad judgement? Of course, but 2013 and 2022 are very different times
2. her ability to craft effective corporate communications is not diminished by the poor judgement mentioned above that she exercised *once*. Presumably, she was hired by other firms (and perhaps rehired by her old firm) not because of her fame, but because she was actually skilled at what she does.

Edit 2: while I havent seen it, the sheer number of references to The Family Guy seems to indicate that yes, they did parody this situation in an episode. Seems like Seth McFarlanes brand of humor.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199091.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Had a supervisor who decided to get blitzed on morphine and alcohol before writing a racist, incomprehensible, unprofessional email and sending it to every subordinate. Every single person turned against him, and he was gone from his job really quickly after that. (And he was tenured and everything). Happened in an instant.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199092.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Activision Blizzard

Cometstarlight replied:

And this is on multiple fronts.

Their industry?

-bugged launches, lying about game content, having games with microtransactions totaling up to over $100,000 as a pay to win scheme

Their actual company?

-Cubicle romps to harass women co workers, the Bill Cosby suite, harassing a woman to suicide, passing over women for promotions because they might get pregnant and take time off work, etc.

There is so, so much wrong with that company and the kicker now is that their in house investigation said they did nothing wrong.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199093.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

NacreousFink added:

I believe there were some other social media posts at that time that was also bad for Fyre Festivals reputation.

And there was that one guy who for months in advance was warning people that the Fyre Festival was a scam.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199094.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Was either Lt Governor or Governor of Vermont from 1987 to 2003, and making a respectable run for president when it stopped dead in its tracks when he made...a weird sounding cheer at a campaign stop.

<span style="font-size:4em">27. Jim Marshall. One of the greatest defensive linemen in NFL football history.

To quote vikings.com : A valued member of Minnesotas Purple People Eaters defensive line, Marshall holds numerous NFL records that include the most seasons played by a defensive player (20, along with Junior Seau and Darrell Green), most consecutive games by a defensive player (282), most consecutive starts by a defensive player (270), and most career fumble recoveries (30). Marshall, who was still a starter at age 42, helped the Vikings win three NFC titles along with the NFL championship in 1969.

However, one day, in one game, Jim Marshall had a quick lapse in judgement and now almost EVERY NFL fan remembers Jim Marshall for one mistake he made: He picked up a fumble and ran the wrong way.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87199100.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
