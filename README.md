<span style="font-size:4em">6. Teddy Roosevelt’s 1907 hunting guide Ben Lilly
Roosevelt wrote of Lilly:

“There is a white hunter, Ben Lily [sic], who has just joined us who is a really remarkable character. He literally lives in the woods. … He had tramped for twenty-four hours through the woods, without food or water, and had slept a couple of hours in a crooked tree, like a turkey. He has a wild, gentle face, with blue eyes and full beard; he is a religious fanatic and is as hardy as a bear or elk, literally caring nothing for fatigue and exposure which we couldn’t stand at all. … He was particularly fond of the chase of the bear, which he followed by himself with one or two dogs; often he would be on the trail of his quarry for days at a time, lying down to sleep wherever night overtook him.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87182243.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Polar historians regard the voyage of the crew in a 22.5-foot (6.9 m) ship’s boat through the Furious Fifties as one of the greatest small-boat journeys ever completed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87182245.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">14 Small Details Hidden in Disney Movies </a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. In the scene where the animals seem to go crazy, while the dentist is attending to his niece Darla, the child in the waiting room frightened by the commotion and screaming is holding a Mr. Incredible comic book, the protagonist of Pixar’s next movie.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181129.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. In 2009, the production company released the film Up and it was a great success. But in the scene where the house flies through the window of a little girl’s room, you can also see Lotso the bear next to her bed. He’d later turn out to be the new antagonist of the third installment of Toy Story 3. Similarly, in the house of the witch in Brave, released in 2012, you can see Sulley in a wood carving. He’s the protagonist of Monsters University, which was released the following year.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181130.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. In Toy Story 2, we discover that Woody is a very old collector’s doll, coveted by many fans. That shows that it had to have been acquired long before the other toys Andy plays with. In fact, the creators of the saga have made it clear that before being owned by Andy Jr., the intrepid cowboy belonged to Andy Sr.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181131.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. In case you hadn’t noticed, the famous Pizza Planet delivery van appears in almost every film that was released after Toy Story. The picture above proves it, take a look: 1. its first appearance in Toy Story, 2. Brave, 3. Monster University, 4. WALL-E, 5. Bugs, and 6. Finding Nemo.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181133.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Many people may have wondered how Prince Eric could have mistaken Ariel for the human version of Ursula when the differences between the two of them are so striking. One has red hair and blue eyes and the other is a brunette with darker eyes. This is because the only image he has of her came from when he saw her on the beach. But then the sun was shining right on him and he was just waking up from an unconscious state. Take a look at the image above and you’ll understand everything.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181134.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. It is not a secret, nor is it hidden that on Pocahontas’ right arm there is a tattoo. It is a peculiarity since this small detail makes her the only tattooed princess in Disney history. This is inspired by a true story, that of the daughter of the chief of the Powhatan tribe, for whom tattoos were commonplace for both men and women.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181135.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Pixar will never miss an opportunity to remind us in very subtle ways what other films they have available or will be releasing soon. In Zootopia, for instance, you can see versions of their other movies, some released and some not. However, they’re all adapted to the animal world, so you see a pig for Big Hero 6, a horse for Tangled, a rhine for Wreck-it Ralph, and so on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181136.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. If you take a closer look at the almanac in which Mike Wazowski is counting down the days for the final exam, you’ll see that the shade of red between the “x’s” is not the same. The older, dry “x’s” have a dark red color that clearly differentiates them from the fresh, intense red of the new ones.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181137.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. No stone is left unturned in Pixar’s movies. The proof of it is that animators added to this character even a small detail that lots of cooks and chefs have. It is very common for them to have small burns on their forearms. They get them accidentally when putting food on the grills or ovens or when taking it out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181132.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. This movie has something in common with Brother Bear. They were made at Disney Studios Orlando before it was totally transformed into a theme park. In fact, Mulan was the first and was released just before Lilo and Stitch. On the wall of Lilo’s room, a poster of her predecessor can be seen hanging.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181138.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Within the imaginary worlds that animators create for their stories, there are certain places that are inspired by real life. Landscapes, castles, panoramic views of cities, or in this case, a train station. When the characters of Wreck-It Ralph want to leave their games, they travel through the electrical connection until they reach Central Station, from where they can go to all the games in the room. This fictional station was inspired by the actual, extremely busy Grand Central Station in New York.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181139.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Mothers seem to have twenty eyes, they see everything, even before it happens, and Helen Parr, the mother of the Incredible family, could not fail to have this maternal and natural gift. In the scene in the image, in which she falls from a plane into the sea with two of her children, she seems to guess that something is going to fall on them and she pushes her little ones out of the way. Watching the scene shot by shot or in slow motion, you can see how in a split second, she sees the reflection of the falling object in the water and pushes her children away. As we said, a mother doesn’t miss a thing.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181140.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. In Toy Story 3, Buzz suffers a malfunction and starts acting strangely. While his friend Woody tries to get him back to normal, he exposes his batteries, which are none other than the Buy n Large brand. This large chain, in the movie WALL-E, was the manufacturer of both the main robot in charge of cleaning the planet of pollution and the space cruisers that house humans in space.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181141.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. After so many years including Easter Eggs everywhere, many fans began to develop theories about a possible connection between all of them. The idea is that there could be a Disney multiverse in which all the stories are developed in parallel. It’d be something similar was what Marvel created for its MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Finally, through an official video on the Toy Story social media accounts, Pixar confirmed that these theories are not so far-fetched after all and that there is a certain connection between all of these stories.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87181142.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
