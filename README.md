<span style="font-size:4em">1. Him: too bad the babysitter died. Me: no she didn’t bud, she’s just not here today. Him: or she’s in the freezer (while staring at the freezer) Me: you’re pretty creepy sometimes bud Him: just smiles.

<span style="font-size:4em">2. My son tells me stories of scary uncle Michael in his bedroom at night. He says hes a grey man that looks like his uncle and he climbs on walls and calls out to him and one night he tried to eat him. Yep, nightmare fuel.

<span style="font-size:4em">4. My little sister had some creepy moments when we were younger. She often claimed that “people” were in her bathroom at night talking, and watching her. She called them “Po and the Tape Monster”. There are a couple of stories regarding them, both funny and creepy.

<span style="font-size:4em">
One night she woke up scared and went to my parents’ room to sleep with them. Before she went back to sleep, she used their bathroom, and when she came out she said “Why are there people in your bathroom mommy?” Dad was out of town, mom still swears this was the scariest thing any of my siblings ever did. -u/TheKrazyKrab23</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87193097.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. While I was driving my four-year-old nephew around he spent a solid few minutes telling me about the dead body he stashed in my trunk. This was a long time ago and as far as I know, he isn’t a serial killer.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Creepy and funny. My youngest once said to me: “I could make three baby hands out of your hand meat.”

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Definitely thought it was more funny than creepy, but when my kid was 2 he was scribbling on a piece of paper and quietly sang (to the tune of Row, Row, Row Your Boat) Scrape, scrape, scrape your eyes, scrape your eyes today.

-u/Zanarkandite</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87193099.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. My kid keeps talking about the babies in the walls of his bedroom. Very off-putting.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. My mom loves telling me this story about the time I discovered hypnotism. When I was four, I found out about hypnotism. I don’t remember how, but apparently, I became fascinated by the idea of having mind control abilities. One day, my mom says my grandpa loaded me into the car for one of our normal grocery store outings only for him to return an hour later “furious.” 
</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87193102.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
After he calmed down, he told my mom that I refused to stop staring him down in the rear view mirror with a very serious look on my face. He had asked me to stop on several occasions but said I never really replied. I just kept staring menacingly. Then, he said all of a sudden I looked into his eyes and said, “Papa…. I’m going to hippo-tize you…. I’m going to put my toe… in your mouth.” My mom said she thought it was funny at the time, but couldn’t laugh because my grandfather was seriously so enraged.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. My ex-father-in-law died a couple of years before my daughter was born so she never met him. He was known as a pretty funny guy, always quick with a one-liner. As strange as it sounds, there were no pictures of him around until my daughter was about 4 years old and my ex-mother-in-law set one next to the urn where his ashes were kept. 
</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87193091.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
The first time my daughter saw the picture she pointed to it and said, “That’s grandpa! I like when he looks in my window and makes me laugh. I don’t like his friends, though.” She had never mentioned this. When I tried to ask her about it, she seemed nonchalant. She’s older now and says she doesn’t remember it. I’ll never forget it.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. My youngest (was 4) was on the carpet playing with his cars.
Son: I can’t wait to get a new house when this house explodes
Me: (half listening) Uh-huh, sure that sounds… wait, what??
Son: yeah when our house explodes, be ready and we’ll just run out real fast (and then he turned back to playing with cars like nothing was said)
Thankfully that was 5 years ago, and my house has not exploded.

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Just after my little brother was born my mom, 3 y.o. sister and I were talking about what not to do around the baby. Things like not leaving small toys out or throwing balls around the baby. After a few minutes my sister chimed in and said, and you dont cut off babies lips with a sharp knife.

<span style="font-size:4em">15. How come youre not waking up tomorrow?

<span style="font-size:4em">16. My son was around 3 at the time. Kept refusing to go downstairs as that’s where angel man was, and angel man wanted to hurt the family.

-u/New_journey868</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87193113.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. When I was about six or seven, the house we were renting was going to be sold. My parents instructed us to keep our rooms tidy because people may be walking through the house during showings. I had the idea to take a little box and write “fortunes” on it. Inside were little slips of paper with “fortunes”. The idea was that prospective buyers could take a slip of paper to get their fortune, kind of like a fortune cookie. 
</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87193114.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
I remember the first couple of slips of paper said stuff like “you will have good luck”. Then the rest of them had some pretty morbid stuff like “you’re going to die”. My parents read the slips of paper beforehand, then sat me down and sternly told me the fortune box was a no-go. I was a pretty serious child, it didn’t occur to me that a fortune box should be light-hearted. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87193110.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. “Music was great and it was exciting to be at the beginning of new technology but not have it consume our lives. You could still go out for the day and be completely unreachable and that was normal.” - queuedUp
 
</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191511.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “Unless you were around at the time, its hard to describe the positive vibe/feeling of hope that existed in that era. The Cold War was over, that meant the threat of nuclear war was over and we could focus on moving mankind to a better place. Society felt united not divided like it is today. Daily life involved face to face interaction with people. There were stores to go to, I especially miss bookstores and record shops. Life was a lot more laid back, no one expected an instant reply; it might take a couple of days to get hold of a friend.” - extra_less</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191512.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “Well there was a genuine air of positivity before the millennium, before everything went to shit after 9/11 and the phoney wars etc..” - rotwilder</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191513.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “Internet wasn’t rotting society yet.” - mamadovah1102</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191514.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “Im German and the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification of Germany made many people believe that theres a wonderful future ahead. Unfortunately that wasnt true.” - ohara1250</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191515.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “The Cold War had just come to an end. There was a feeling that liberal democracy had triumphed over other systems and that a new era of increasing freedom and prosperity for all had begun (The end of history).” - HighlandsBen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191517.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “We had enough technology to get by, and make life easier but it didn’t run our lives. You could leave your house for a night out with friends and your parents wouldn’t be able to find you. The music, the fashion, malls, mass shootings every damn day wasn’t a thing. Gas was .89 a gallon. It was glorious!” - worldsokayestmomx3</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191516.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. “The goth chicks man. Loved the 90s goth chicks.” - Inner-Nothing7779</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191518.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “We were forced to live in the moment and it felt amazing. When you heard your favorite song on the radio, you relished it because there was no other way for you to access the song (other than buying the tape). When you had not seen your friends in a while, you genuinely miss them because the only way to keep in touch were through letters and phone calls. When you watched a concert, you had to absorb it all in because there was no practical way you could record your experience. Life just felt more present and authentic.” - papaweir</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191519.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “My take: Watch “Star Trek: The Next Generation” and then watch “Star Trek: Picard”. The hopeful, aspirational tone of the former reflected the optimism in the 90s. The rather more dreary tone of the latter reflects today’s pessimism and fatalism. If you watch and agree with this assessment, ask yourself in which setting you would rather live.” - rogless</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191520.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “The economy was booming, the internet was exciting and new, culture seemed to be moving toward more inclusion, acceptance, and diversity. People my age (Im a Xennial) were raised with a belief that every new generation in America is better and more prosperous than the generation that came before, and since we would be the most educated generation ever, the future looked bright. That dreamy ultramodern view of progress that started in the 60s -- we were living it. It was our future, and it was right around the corner. Needless to say, that amazing future never materialized. The internet has seemed to make people dumber rather than better educated, and to top it all off, America is now a backsliding democracy. Yeah, we have electric cars and fancy phones and sh*t, but life is getting worse for the average American, and our culture just generally sucks. People are so angry, about everything. I think those of us old enough to remember the 80s and 90s mostly just miss having hope.” - AccessibleBeige</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191521.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “The vibes were just better. It seemed like people were happier and more content with what they did have. Now it seems like everyone is in the hustle mode and not truly happy. The nation also seemed more united at that time. There seemed to be more patriotism and less division.” - SquareAffectionate64</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191522.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “I think it was the way people treated each other, as well as the fact that it was simpler times without social media. Also, nature in my part of the world was still flourishing. I tell my SO all the time about how many fireflies, butterflies, and other insects there used to be all over our small town. Humans have made our culture and environment worse since the 90s, in my opinion. Sure, there was still bullying and shitty people in the 90s like there are now, but I felt more of a sense of community. Your friends would call your house, have to talk to a parent first usually, and then your mom and dad would yell for you to come get the phone. Then youd all meet up in the neighborhood and have a good time doing whatever it was you were doing. People didnt seem so suspicious of one another and weird about things. People seemed a lot less narcissistic and less concerned with how others perceived them. There wasnt so much time wasted staring at your phone and youd have to do things like talk to each other instead. People seemed a lot more caring and less selfish back then. Thank you for reading my incoherent morning thoughts about a time of my life I loved.” - Betty_Broops</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191523.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “No cell phones or social media. Unplugged before there was a thing called unplugged. Really miss that.” - waterbottlejesus</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191524.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. “The simplicity of it. Those of us that grew up in it have seen one world end, and another begin. We saw the rise of personal computers and the internet. It was all so new and fresh and really cool. But it also signaled the end of the pre-internet era. We are the last generation to grow up outside. The last generation that didnt grow up with the ills of the world thrown into our faces 24/7. The last generation to truly have an innocent childhood. When that era ended, and social media and the internet became a big part of everyones lives, we started seeing all the terrible things going on in the world. Kids were exposed to it. Everything became political. If you werent angered by X then the Xers hated you. If you were angered by Y you hated the Xers, etc. All that hate and divisiveness has grown and grown until we have the angry, hateful, tired, and stressed society we have now. The 90s were simple. We had no worries. Just cool music, clothes, tv shows, etc. We lived and didnt worry about things outside our local bubble, with exceptions of course. It was simple.” - Inner-Nothing7779</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87191525.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Before becoming the LSD-fueled hippie guru who defined the 1960s and 70s, Ram Dass was a stuffy academic named Richard Alpert. While working as an assistant professor of clinical psychology at Harvard, Alpert had a fateful meeting with LSD pioneer Timothy Leary, and together they embarked upon a series of mind-altering and controversial experiments. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176516.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

In 1962, Alpert and Leary conducted the famous Good Friday Experiment, historys first controlled study of the connection between psychedelic drugs and mystical experiences, right inside the chapel at Boston University. The experiment got both men fired from Harvard, prompting Alpert to take a spiritual journey to India that saw him reinvent himself as the guru Ram Dass — and made him an icon of the hippie movement.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176490.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. In October 1983, Tami Oldham Ashcraft and her fiancé, Richard Sharp, began a 4,000-mile sailing trip from Tahiti to San Diego. Three weeks into the journey, they were hit by a category 4 hurricane that capsized their ship and knocked Ashcraft unconscious.⁠</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176497.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Some 27 hours later, she awoke to find that her fiance was gone and she was stranded alone in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. With only a sextant and watch, Ashcraft journeyed for 41 days until she found the coast of Hawaii.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176492.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Harry Haft was just a teenager when he was sent to Auschwitz. Once he arrived, the Nazi guards found out that he had some boxing experience — so they ordered him to fight his fellow prisoners in harrowing boxing matches where the loser would be executed. Forced to literally fight for his life, Haft never lost a single match, even though he would have known many of his opponents because the Nazis regularly sent people from the same town to the same concentration camps. From 1943 to 1945, he was forced to fight at least 76 people, none of whom he ever saw alive again.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176494.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Only in April 1945 did Haft manage to escape during a death march away from the camp — by killing a Nazi soldier and stealing his uniform. Haft then spent weeks running from village to village. Trained to fight to the death, he even killed an elderly couple who offered him shelter after he suspected theyd discovered that he wasnt really a Nazi. By the time he made it to Allied-controlled Germany, he weighed only 110 pounds and spent the next two years recovering in a refugee camp. But by 1947, he decided to fight again and immigrated to America to become a professional boxer — where he took on some of the biggest names in the sport.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176496.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. At age 17, Juliane Koepcke was sucked out of an airplane after it was struck by lightning. She fell over 2 miles to the ground still strapped to her plane seat and somehow lived. She then had to endure a 9-day walk through the Amazon jungle before eventually being rescued by loggers. She was the sole survivor of LANSA Flight 508 that killed 93 people in December 1971.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176498.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. By the age of 12, Drew Barrymore was already a self-described party girl — thanks to her mom who took her to nightclubs in Los Angeles and New York. By the time she turned 14, she had spent a year in rehab, been emancipated from her parents, and lived in her own apartment.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176499.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. By the time she was 17, Judy Garland was already reliant on pep pills, a.k.a. amphetamines, and was being hounded by studio executives regarding her weight and looks. One executive called her a fat hunchback and encouraged her to smoke in order to suppress her appetite.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176500.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Garlands grueling work schedule — coupled with a strict diet of black coffee, chicken soup, and cigarettes imposed upon her by her Hollywood bosses — set the stage for her lifetime of body dysmorphia and substance abuse. The star attempted suicide at least 20 times in her life until her fatal overdose at 47.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176501.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. This is Simo Häyhä, the deadliest sniper in world history with over 500 confirmed kills in less than 100 days. He used no scope on his rifle and once held off over 4,000 Soviets with only 31 other Finns.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176502.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Over the course of the Winter War, which lasted roughly 100 days, Häyhä killed between 500 and 542 Russian soldiers, all with his antiquated rifle. While his comrades were using state-of-the-art telescopic lenses to zoom in on their targets, Häyhä was fighting with an iron sight, which he felt gave him a more precise target.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176503.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Former NFL star Pat Tillman was hailed as a hero in 2004 after he was killed by the Taliban. But it was a lie — hed been killed by friendly fire. And while the shooting has since been described as accidental, some believe it was intentionally planned by the U.S. Army.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176505.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Not only was Tillman shot three times in the head, but he was also shot at close range and it was later determined that the Army had lied about his unit being ambushed by the enemy. Eerily, all of Tillmans personal items had been burned — including his uniform and private journals. On top of that, rumors had surfaced that he was about to go public about his opposition to the invasion of Iraq and the War on Terror with a televised meeting with Noam Chomsky. But this meeting would never happen.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176506.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. When Joe Pichler was just six years old, he made his acting breakthrough with a commercial for a Seattle department store. Soon after, he moved to Los Angeles, where he landed a part in 1999s Varsity Blues before earning a leading role in two installments of the Beethoven franchise.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176507.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Pichler then moved back to his hometown of Bremerton, Washington to attend high school and had plans to return to Hollywood after he had his braces removed — but he never got the chance. In the early morning hours of January 5, 2006, Pichler mysteriously vanished, and police have been unable to solve his disappearance to this day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176508.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. On September 30, 1999, Hisashi Ouchi was exposed to the highest dose of nuclear radiation in human history. A 35-year-old lab technician at the nuclear plant in Tokaimura, Japan, Ouchi was mixing a uranium solution by hand directly over an open container when he accidentally poured in too much uranium, immediately causing a violent explosion.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176511.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

For the next 83 days, Ouchi suffered unimaginable agony as the radiation worked its way through his body, obliterating his DNA and causing his skin to melt off and his eyes to weep blood before he finally died. And though he begged for death, doctors refused to listen and kept him alive against his will for nearly three excruciating months.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176512.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Todd Beamer was just 32 years old when his flight was hijacked by terrorists on 9/11. A passenger on United Airlines Flight 93, Beamer was forced to think quickly. He first tried calling AT&T, but both of his calls were terminated upon connection. Beamer then attempted to call his wife, but that call was also terminated. Finally, he contacted Airfone operators and was able to connect with a supervisor named Lisa Jefferson. While on the line, he pleaded with Jefferson to tell his pregnant wife and two sons that he loved them, but he also outlined a heroic plan to fight back against the hijackers alongside his fellow passengers and the flight crew. And thats exactly what he did.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176519.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Between 2000 and 2003, biologist Amie Huguenard spent three summers in Alaska with her boyfriend Timothy Treadwell studying and filming grizzly bears. Treadwell, who was better known as the Grizzly Man, had met Huguenard during a book tour in 1996 and the pair had instantly bonded over their love of animals. But then, in October 2003, the couple was brutally mauled and eaten by a half-ton bear that attacked them at their camp. And the audio of their horrifying final moments was captured on tape.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176521.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. In 1989, Billy Idol threw a three-week-long party in his penthouse at the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok. All the sex, drugs, and property damage eventually prompted the hotel to hit Idol with a $250,000 bill.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176522.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

But when he still refused to leave, the military had to be called in to corral the British rocker. Idol was shot with a tranquilizer dart and hauled out on a stretcher before he would finally stop partying.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87176523.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
