<span style="font-size:4em">1. “There was one night where a car stopped up the road, a girl got out, yelled for help, then got back in and they drove off. I have no idea of it was serious or not, considering she got right back in the car…” -abetherigh</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185770.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “Holy shit, Ive got one for this! Grew up in Japan, not too small/not too big city. Worked a job that had me coming home daily at 2-4ish AM. I preferred to walk the backstreet that paralleled the main street home because it felt more cozy and peaceful. Nothing of note happened until one day…

<span style="font-size:4em">
I turn the corner onto the side street and about halfway down there was a young woman. She wasnt doing anything, just staring at the sky. Staring straight up, STRAIGHT up, neck at a 90 degree angle, mouth slightly agape, long black hair hanging. I hesitated but decided that, since nothing weird has ever happened here before, itd be fine. So I went to walk by. I get up next to her, its a narrow road so not a lot of room to maneuver, and pause to look at her.

<span style="font-size:4em">
She hasnt moved or reacted to me, shes just staring away. So I fight my instincts and ask her if shes okay. She doesnt react. I look up to see if shes looking at something but theres nothing there. So now Im thinking theres something medical going on, so I reach out and touch her on the shoulder. She jolts and and looks at me like shes just noticed me. I ask if shes okay and she just stammers and says sorry before hustling down the street the same way I was headed. I decided to smoke a cigarette to let some distance get between me and her, but towards the end of the street, she stops and stares at the sky again. Doesnt move for the whole five minutes it takes for me to finish my cig. I walked down the main street for the next couple nights.” -Post-Alone0</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185775.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “During winter in a rural no cell service kind of area. Completely dark, no street lights nor anyone in sight. Temperatures were around 20 and it was snowing. I was walking my dog with a flashlight. Then I heard someone start screaming bloody murder. Flight or fight kicked in; it truly sounded like someone was being stabbed to death for what seemed like forever.

<span style="font-size:4em">
I chose to find out what the hell was going on. What I found instead was beyond anything I expected. He was a 5 year old boy wandering down the road all alone. All he was wearing were light flannel pants and a thin t-shirt. No shoes or hat. And screaming so loudly it echoed through the hills. I dropped my dogs leash and walked up to him slowly; gently and repeatedly telling him that I’m a mom and that he’s going to be ok. I wrapped him into my arms and carried him to a neighbors home to warm him by the fire and call for help.” -BlueRaining</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185777.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “One time I turned around to see what was behind me just out of intuition, and I saw someone step behind a tree rather quickly and try to hide from me. I stood there for a second to confirm this, then I speed-walked home. F**king creepy. -THCRANGER</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185778.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “I’m an overnight security guard. One night I was watching cameras and saw someone underneath a grass tarp where some landscaping was taking place on our property. I was guessing this person had probably tried to stash something before they went into detox which is next door to our property. I get over to the tarp and don’t see the guy anywhere. So I start walking over the tarp and lifting it to look for any stashed items. Well I ended up stepping on the poor homeless guy, scared the shit out of me. He was cool though and we fist bumped and he went on his way.” -Doch1112</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185779.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “One time I was walking around my relatively safe neighborhood with two of my friends after midnight (we were probably 16 at the time). This loud red truck speeds by us, which is normal for the road we were on. Then a few minutes later the same red truck drives by the opposite way going much slower. Again just a couple of minutes later he drives by but this time stops a hundred or so feet away from us and just sits there.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Realizing that this is not normal we booked it through the yard to the next street over. For the next 20 or so minutes we see this truck creeping up and down the neighborhood while we hid behind some bushes and when we finally thought he was gone, we booked it to my house. He turned the corner onto my road just as we were about to open my front door.” -mattyb584</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185782.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “Almost 100% sure I witnessed a kidnapping. I was going to get my mail late at night while living in an apartment complex and on the way back I noticed a woman in her pajamas surrounded by a few men right by a car. There was an argument and looked like they forced her in the car and drove off, I found her slipper nearby on the grass. I of course called the police and they came and I let them know what I saw but I never found out what actually happened.” -kinetochore21</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185784.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. “I worked night shift for 7 years. One night a young, thin blonde woman was walking down the street at 2am with no pants or underwear on and a button up shirt open. I tried to ask if she needed help and she just stared forward, slowly walking staring forward. I called the police and they came and stood infront of her and she slowly walked into the cops hand and stopped. I didnt stay and went back to work. I still think about her and what the f**k was going on. I tell myself it was sleep walking on Ambien or something, and that she wasnt just assaulted and in complete shock. Ill never know. But she was very pretty, and seemed well groomed. Was very strange.” -IndIka123</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185785.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “Not me, but my friend was near downtown at 3am on acid and was almost kidnapped. There’s a lot of young female kidnappings where we’re at and because he’s petite with long hair, he was mistaken as a female target. He managed to run away, but it was of course very traumatizing for him.” -flotsamjr</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185787.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “I worked night shift on Kadena AB on Okinawa, Japan. I started walking to work because I didnt have a car. I really enjoyed the walks. It was a good way to wind down after work as the nights were cool and quiet and I could listen to my music without worrying about anyone else around. One night while walking home I heard some rustling in the jungle of trees on the way home. Next thing I know all of the lights went black and all I heard/felt was a loud wooooosh coming right at my head. I screamed like a little girl, ran, and dropped my ipod (it broke). Once I made it past the trees I realized it was one of the giant bats that lived on Okinawa. It scared the ever living sh*t out of me.” -akroses161</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185788.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “An old man who walked very aggressively. Like Jason from Friday the 13th but sped up. I was ready to run but I walked past him and nothing happened. Put me on my toes but holy sh*t change your walking form man.” -micho6</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185794.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “Found a guy who hanged himself in a park. Called 911 and answered some questions, was a long night. - FSD-Bishop</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185790.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. “I’ve never been afraid of the dark. Grew up in the countryside, where the nearest streetlight was 10 miles away, so I’m comfortable in dark places, so much so that I often take my dog for a walk at around midnight just because I like the peace and quiet of the night. I live in a city now so something about the dark is just soothing to me.

<span style="font-size:4em">
That being said, one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced, I genuinely have no explanation for. Living in a city I used to drive out 20-30 miles into the country to do some astrophotography. As I’m driving out one night I see this guy walking at the side of the road with no lights, reflectors and a big backpack. Didn’t think much of it other than it being a little odd. 5 miles later, I see the same guy walking again. I haven’t changed directions, turned, and I’ve been doing 50mph. As I drove past he looked and waved at me. I was pretty spooked but I drove on. I must be imagining things. It can’t be the same guy. I get to my field in the middle of nowhere, park up and get the camera out, and turn off all the lights so my eyes adjust to the dark.

When caterpillars enter the chrysalis phase, they don’t just sprout wings, their entire body first turns into a liquid, soupy substance which then reforms into the butterfly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87186359.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Crows recognize individual people even if they are wearing disguises and after many years. (The people are wearing disguises, not the crows.)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87186360.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. All the deep sea anglerfish you see pictures of with the lil lights hanging over their heads? Theyre all female.

The males are tiny and born with a terribly weak jaw and a massive hunger. They seek out a female, and torn between hungry and horny they bite her.

She then releases an enzyme that fuses the male to her body. She slowly absorbs them into her body with only their lil testicles remaining so she can instantly fertilize her eggs when she wants to.

Some females have rows and rows of lil testicles on their bodies from where they have absorbed multiple males.

<span style="font-size:4em">28. The Inland Taipan (snake) has the strongest/potent venom on the planet, capable of killing around 290 humans with a single bite. Scaled to mice, a single bite could kill 250,000 mice.


That said, bites from the Inland Taipan to humans have been ***pretty rare*** as they usually stay underground and are not overly aggressive unless you jump all over their burrow. They also have a good number of predators who prey on them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87186385.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Baby Koalas nuzzles their mothers butt to releases a runnier, protein-rich substance, called pap which they then drink to get moms gut bacteria, helpful in digesting eucalyptus leaves.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87186386.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. The bearded vulture or bone-eating vulture, is a rare eur-asian vulture that only eats marrow, that looks rusty in color but is in fact white. This rusty color is because they actually paint themselves with red clay deposits to look attractive to their mates. They are really cool looking.

They have a little tuft of feathers below their beaks that looks like the beard of a dragon, so that is why they are called that.

Other cool fact: They can dissolve bone in the acid of their stomach in 24 hours. The PH of their stomachs is 1 which is VERY acidic. They are the only vulture species in the world that 90% of its diet is just bone.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87186387.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">31. The vast majority of Greenland sharks are blind thanks to a special parasite that eats their eyes and replaces them.

It is thought that this might actually be helpful because a) their eyesight was s**t anyway, b) the parasites wave like lures and may have an anglerfish-like effect, and c) the sharks are super slow so that might be one of the few ways for them to catch live prey.

Imagine something eating your eyeballs and it being an *upgrade*.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87186388.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “A woman known as a pretty awful person disappeared. Everyone knows it was probably her husband, but the family owns over 10,000 acres and no body has been found. The rest of her family is ramping up an awareness campaign so should be interesting to see where this all goes.” - Ordo_501</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185844.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “The last thing that was super polarizing in my town was a painting on the front of a toy store called inland octopus in our downtown. It was an octopus playing with a bunch of toys. Well our town is very very strict about our old school downtown. They ordered them to paint over it with brick orange paint.

<span style="font-size:4em">
The store owner said hell no and it went to court for weeks. All the while the city was charging a huge fine every single day the painting stayed. A couple of the local millionaires kept paying the fine. They didnt care about the painting. They just liked the drama and like to stick it to the city. eventually the toy store lost and now its just a huge ugly brick orange wall in the middle of downtown. Us locals still talk about now and then. But at the time it was an uproar.” - Large-Statistician-3</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185847.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “While fleeing another hit and run, and possible DUI, some dude tried to go full speed directly thru the middle of our town square. The problem with that is we have a big historic fountain there. Traffic is usually supposed to swerve around the fountain, he did not. This dude in a white SUV ramps into our fountain, and smashes into the center pillar.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Thankfully the fountain was off for the winter, so there was less damage, but they still have no clue how, and how much money its gonna take to fix this mess. The car was removed, but the fountain is still wrapped up in its tarp a month later. Theres security cam footage of the ramp and its all anyone could talk about for a few weeks.” - raven_1313</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185850.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “Car was spotted in a field burnt to a crisp on New Years Day. Found around noon since nobody was out and around. Farmer finally drove by and called the land owner to see if he knew about it, which he did not. Hearing that he approached the vehicle until he was about 20ft away and noticed a burnt body next to it. He then called 911. Nothing was known about who it was till a missing person was reported later that day, car and body were so burnt no identifying could be done immediately.

Two cameras caught the whole thing from local farm grain bins. Video showed the car in the field and then light moving as if it was stuck and trying to get out. Assumptions are the catalytic converter started the fire but no one knows for sure. All happened at around 2 am. Not much controversy but definitely the talk of the town. Funeral for the man was a week and a half ago.” - tomsdragon</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185853.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Nothing current but I have a great one from 5 years ago: So we had a guy who was quite the Libertarian. He owned a gun store in town and pretty much kept to himself. He will be known as LibGuy. The problem started when he decided to have chickens for his own eggs but he lived within the city proper which had a rule against farm animals within the city (this is a rural farming area I live in).

One of the city council members (he shall be known as A-hole) discovered he had chickens a few weeks after he got them and the city sent him a letter telling him he had to get rid of them. Well, he was not going to go down without a fight. So he spent some time looking into things and discovered the A-hole who reported him lived within the city and he also had chickens. Well, this of course caused a bit of a scandal. The city ended up claiming there was a grandfather clause for anyone who had livestock within the city prior to the rule change 17 years ago.

The problem with that was that clause applied to the A-holes father, not the A-hole who lived at the same address. Needless to say, the war was on! A couple of weeks go by and the town cops are messing with Libguy over petty sh*t. Libguy somehow gets a recording of A-hole calling the police and lying to them about what Libguy was doing. Police now want to charge Libguy for some absurd ridiculous recording law that really doesnt apply since it was someone with the police dept who gave him the tape not that he stole it.

<span style="font-size:4em">
This gets blown up to the point where the bigger cities news crews are now showing up to city council meetings that are being called to address this issue. These meetings are getting absurdly blown out of proportion and in all honesty somewhat slimy in how the city is handling it. Libguy subpoenas the city council emails to show there was a concerted effort to f**k with him and cover for A-hole. Well in the course of getting the Emails it was discovered that there was a sexting issue going on between three of the city council members. LMAO, believe me when I say this did not involve people that would be considered sexy. All three (2 women and 1 male) were married, 200lbs plus, and in their 50s. I mean Emails about double-dildos, pegging, swinging...etc..It was hilarious. In the end, the Libguy got the last laugh.

He lost his chickens but found a loophole where he could actually own Llamas in the city since they were not considered livestock. So he put up a fence all around his yard (ugly chicken wire fence) just tall enough so the Llamas could not get out by jumping. People actually would go by walking their dogs and pet the Llamas. The problem though was that Llamas sh*t like cows and it stinks in such a small enclosure. This went on for about a year until he sold his house and moved (it stunk for at least a block around his property and he lived right behind the towns grocery store). Two of the council members involved got divorced over the sexting issue and the third one sold her bar because of it. This was the infamous chicken scandal that plagued my town of 4K for 3 years.” - blgiant</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185862.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. “A guy wanted to bury his parents on their (parents’) slightly rural, totally out of the way, virtually-no-neighbors property, but the village said no way. We don’t do that here. We’re classy. So he went to the state for permission to build a funeral home/crematorium instead, and he built a giant mausoleum with both their caskets right on the corner of the property where everyone and their grandma can see it when they drive by! And he has zero plans to actually turn this into a functioning business. It’s about half done, no landscaping, and construction vehicles parked all over the place. Gotta hand it to him!” - Axel0812</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185863.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “I dont live in a small town but my small bit of the city were amused today. A woman posted in the local neighborhood Facebook group to say a woman had knocked on her door at 6:25am. The reason was she had tracked her missing husbands phone to the address. He had not come back the night before. The man was not there and the poster was a bit concerned. This led to much chat about burglaries and whether she should post the ring doorbell footage. A man then joined the thread to apologize. It was the missing man. He had got drunk at the football game and ended up falling asleep in the house next door to the woman who posted on Facebook. Much hilarity.” - choirleader</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185864.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “A lady who has lived in the neighborhood forever has started losing her mind and is stealing lawn ornaments, pots, plants, etc from everyone elses yard. The police refuse to arrest her because the situation is sad. So every few months the police host a get back your sh*t event and we just collect our things from her yard. It is surreal but I wish her the best.” - grizzljt</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185866.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
