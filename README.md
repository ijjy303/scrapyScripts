I also believe most people dont realize the government has worked directly with media companies since at least WW2 in an effort to sway public opinion in their favor. Add on the theater of left/right politics, 24hr talk shows posing as news and a executive order allowing the US people to openly be bombarded with harmful propaganda.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87180249.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

His big secret was that there were supposedly a ton of anonymous, unregulated/illegal trading accounts within their system doing a shit ton of trading volume that all employees were told to ignore and not ask about. Apparently you have to go through a lot of certifications and identity stuff to open a fund of that type, yet these had none of that and were clearly black box slush funds of some kind, maybe worse.

Old guy lighting up a crack pipe near the door between cars? Just ignore the smell. Woman near you screaming at the top of her lungs at her silent child? Keep listening to your music.

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I love the show Law and Order, but I have to wonder how much damage its done to our public view of police officers. On the show, if someone takes the 5th, theyre guilty. If a cop beats up a suspect, they were guilty. Heck, if they shoot them, interrogate them hard, frame them, lie to them, hack their personal computers, etc... its all okay, because theyre guilty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125408/87179995/propoganda1.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. America’s Got Talent.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. The entire cop show genre.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Any news targeting stock owners. Not the big companies, but the private people who have a few thousand dollars worth or less.

Then big companies buy up billions of dollars worth and this swings the price back up. Then they sell it again making a fortune.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125516/87180006/propoganda11.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
