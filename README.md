## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">15 Unexpected Details from Industry Insiders</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. “Former hotel worker. If a place is clearly low on guests, you can pretty much get a room for next to nothing if you ask nice enough and are good to the front desk agents. Corporate hates vacancies, so they’d rather have something than nothing.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164090.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “Environmental scientist…….nothing is ever completely cleaned up…..”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164087.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “Funeral industry here. I have no interest in your dead relative, or anything about them or you. I bury people 6 days a week and cant be bothered to k ow anything more than “does the name on my paperwork match the name on this headstone or flag in the cemetery”. To me, this is just Thursday.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164088.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “Not really a dirty secret but more of a lot of miscommunication. There is no allergy friendly carpet. If you are allergic to dust the fibers themselves will always cling to dust like velcro regardless of coatings composition or weave. You can get some carpets that are more resistant but if you or a loved one have a serious allergy carpet is a no-go… a myth of wool being better or triexta being better has been perpetrated by people thinking something all natural is always better when they still have the same issues.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164089.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “Home based service providers are hired directly out of college to be paid low and burn out and then quit. To be replaced by a fresh batch of graduates.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164091.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “People might be surprised store-bought name brand food in many circumstances is no different than the generic version. The contract food manufacturer’s just switch out the packaging a lot of the times.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164093.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “While filming porn the SMELLS are often HORRIBLE.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164094.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. “There are a lot of large, old chillers and HVAC units that leak CFCs and HCFCs into the atmosphere that keep getting band-aid patches for years, simply because the owners don’t want to pay the cost to replace them. A LOT.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164095.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “I am a locksmith. There are plenty of secrets in our industry. But the dirty secret, in my view, is just how many companies there are out there, who will attend a simple lockout job, that could and should be solved with non-destructive entry techniques, and instead drill out the customers lock barrel, risk damaging their nightlatch, and make a mess, then charge the customer over the odds for replacement locks or parts thereof.

That kind of crap makes me furious. If you aren’t in the job to secure and protect your client, using your mechanical and technical skill, if you are in the job to exploit people, victimise them and basically steal from them, then you need arrested and thrown in jail, alongside the people you are supposed to be helping protect your clientele from.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164086.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “Not my current profession but my previous. If you ordered prime rib from our restaurant we would actually under cut the portions to save more money. The minimum the cooks were instructed to under cut was 1 ounce and up to 2.5 ounces depending on the order size. Guests started realizing the differences from past dining experiences and management was instructed to ‘convince’ them that nothing has changed.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164096.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “The salads at my job are exactly the same size, the small one is just out in a bigger bowl to make it look smaller and we charge more for the “big” salad.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164097.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “Pornstar here. “Cum shots” in porn (photos anyways, not videos) are made with facial cleansers, not actual cum. Those cumming will save it for the actual scene itself, not the before pictures.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164098.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “I’m a nanny. I don’t follow all the parents rules and do whatever is easiest for me during the day.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164092.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “Working at a strip club. If you don’t tip the dj well or you piss him off, he will put the green lights on you while on stage. The green light makes everyone look x5 worse and it shows every imperfection. Also most of us aren’t actually drinking or drunk. We pretend so men think our guards are down and will spend more because they think they can get away with more. We are great at acting.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164099.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. “I worked at a movie theater… every theater has mice. Increased chances to avoid them if you do not sit near the screen or anywhere with curtains.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87164100.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">20 Athletes Who Played Absolutely Blitzed Out of Their Mind</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Bobby Layne most notably played for the Detroit Lions and won 3 championships. Layne would get his fix every halftime, as he would just take swigs of alcohol during speeches.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030135/87164515/bobbylanye.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Bernie Carbo was both drunk and high during the 1975 world series. He just decided to smoke a joint and drink some beer before the game. Carbo would go on to hit a home run while high AF.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030146/87164516/bernie.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Charles Barkley played a game nice and drunk after he was notified that he may be traded.

He played that same night.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030208/87164518/charlesbark.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Red Sox Pitcher Dennis Boyd was a known drug addict. It got so bad that he even hid crack under his hat. The crack eventually spilled onto the mound.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030219/87164519/dennisboyd.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Fred Thurston once drank 10 vodkas to stay warm. Playing in Green Bay is probably the coldest the place in the NFL, so during the Ice Bowl in 67, Thurston needed his alcohol jacket.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030240/87164522/fred.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. John Daly is a legend in his own right. He once claimed to have drank a fifth of Jack every single day when he was 23. Hes known to drink on the course, and as you can see hes a man who loves his smokes.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030229/87164520/daly.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Keith Hernandez was high on cocaine while playing for the St. Louis Cardinals. Because thats what you did in the 80s.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030251/87164524/keith.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Cowboys player Thomas Henderson was high on cocaine during Super Bowl 13. He used an inhaler and mixed coke with water (which I didnt even know was a thing.)

<span style="font-size:4em">14. The legend of Wade Boggs gets better and better every time you hear it. Boggs has stated that he drank over 100 beers on a cross-country flight and went on to play a game the next day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030157/87164517/boggs.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Ricky Davis and his crew went out before a game in 2000. Allegedly they killed 19 bottles of top-shelf tequila and he would go on to not only play drunk, but barely miss out on a triple double after shooting at his own net.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030326/87164529/rickydavis.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Tim Raines would do cocaine before games. He would then stash the coke his back pocket, which is why he would slide headfirst so as not to crush his bag of cocaine.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030338/87164531/timraines.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. In 1998 David Wells pitched a perfect game for the Yankees. He would later admit that he was still drunk.

LEGEND STUFF!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/10/030350/87164533/wells.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. As legend has it, the White Sox once tried to drink Babe Ruth out of the lineup.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Friend’s dad met a “very nice man” at a farm stand in 2011, couldn’t figure out why the guy looked familiar, so he asked him.
