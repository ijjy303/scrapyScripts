## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">Former Employees Spill Surprising Industry Secrets</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Call center here. Just because you hear music when I put you on hold, doesnt mean I do.I can hear every profanity you utter.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185164.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. I work on a farm. When they say you should wash your produce thoroughly at home, theyre not joking.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185167.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I was a deep sea diver for 10 years in the Gulf of Mexico. Huge oil spills happen and are covered up hundreds of times a year by every company. The entire industry is in on it. The bottom of the gulf is a disgusting garbage dump. Every boat dumps their trash into the gulf. No one obeys the laws and the coast guard doesnt enforce s**t. I had a bunch of requests for an AMA so Im doing one now if anyone has more questions.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185165.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. If you own your own business, never and I mean never do any work for anyone with the promise of more business later on, if they want you to do it free the first time. Just drop them as clients and move on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185166.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Large chain bookstores: so so so many perfectly good books get thrown out...Mass market paperbacks are cheap to manufacture and get shipped out in huge volumes. For some publishers (particularly ones that put out new mysteries or romances quarterly) when the bookstore wants it off the shelf to make room for something new, its just not worth the cost of taking them back and finding someone else to sell it. But they dont want anyone getting them for free. So as a bookstore employee I spent hours ripping the front and back covers off of books, then tearing the book at least in half so that no one could read it later. The covers get sent back to the publishers, and the books that could have been donated to a library or school get put in a locked recycling container out back. A manager had to come back and check my work to make sure the books were not left intact.I almost cried the first time I had to rip up a load of kids books (in a city with high child poverty rates and underfunded schools).</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185163.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. It is impossible to crawl through ventilation shafts. Professional duct worker here.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185168.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. We already have developed better, safer medicines than most of the crap currently on the market. However due to the following reasons, most of it will never reach the market. FDA Approval costs a fair amount of money and time, and for a new drug to be approved takes bloody years. The slightest mess up in testing and back to the beginning. Money. If a new drug discovery is not going to be as profitable as the stuff currently on the market, it will simply be patented and sat on.* Research funding: Not enough of it anymore to properly explore all the possibilities.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185169.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Nurse assistant here. If you have taken any illegal drugs, or prescription drugs to get high within the last 24 hours... F*****G TELL US. It could save your life. We wont judge you for it... But we would judge you for bullsh**ting us even if your life could be at risk.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185170.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Graphic designer here. For the last time, just because we have Photoshop and Illustrator doesnt mean the design process is on auto-pilot. So when we say we need an extra hour to work out your problem, we mean it. And yes, we need the vector file of your logo, or at least a PDF copy of it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185171.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. The groundbreaking scientific results published by the mainstream media bear little resemblance to the results published in the actual scientific article.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185172.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I work in the space industry and I am happy to report that there are no tricks here, everything must work with multiple redundant systems.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185173.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Car dealership. WE ARE SCAMMING YOU.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185174.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Video editor here for reality TV. Its fake for the most part. They usually do multiple takes of the reality scenes that are staged beforehand. The most recent egregious use of this is Duck Dynasty. They pass the show off as reality tv and they actually have table readings for that show before shoots. Not saying that reality TV isnt sometimes entertaining. Im just saying that you shouldnt be fooled into thinking that this is actually reality and the camera just happened to be there when these people were doing what they normally do.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185175.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. I worked for a political consulting firm and was completely floored when congressmen/women would come in for media training (learning to be normal on camera or in front of constituents). Nearly every politician who came in for training was clueless and literally had their views on the issues fed to them by my boss (the media strategist). Sounds obvious, but its really horrifying to witness.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185176.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. From my former job: The US military has a tradition where you spend your entire budget by Oct (the new fiscal year) or you risk losing that portion of your budget. Ive been in units that would go out and purchase $200,000 worth of useless s**t just to avoid having a budget surplus. Multiply by the number of units in the military (a s**t ton) and you have all your fraud, waste and abuse.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185177.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Im in radio. We dont get to pick what we play on air, the pd schedules it and we just talk in between songs. The closest we get is when we play a request, thats usually something we wanted to hear and no one actually requested it.The guys down at the talk station ironically can play whatever they want but think the last good song came out in 1975.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185178.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. When you climb into a helicopter and the rotors are turning, you cant reach your arm up high enough to lose a hand....but we dont want anyone trying to test it or prove us wrong.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185179.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. A lot of people know this, but, the police can lie to you. About damn near anything. If you are ever arrested, shut the f**k up. Request a lawyer. I can repeat this, but you dumb motherf**kers will still talk to the f**king cops. You are soooo much better off just not talking to them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185182.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Retail here. If you argue about the price of something and I dont have an easy way to check it I will probably give it to you for your price....but if you do this I will be silently hating you, at least until you leave the store and I forget you exist.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185183.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. School photographer here. Do not coach your children on how to smile. I can normally get them to smile naturally with a funny word or simply by smiling at them. I have seen MANY kids that have obviously coached smile because they are afraid mom will take away their Playstation. Remember that school photos are a marking of time, love your kid for who they are at that moment. And NEVER tell your kiddo to not show their teeth. Second graders are supposed to have lots of missing teeth-- its charming. Seventh graders have braces-- that photo will remind them of such a tumultuous time in their life. And lastly, there is always re-take day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185184.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Harley Davidson is in pretty bad shape, they store the lions share of their new motorcycles in some warehouses in Montana because they dont want to stop production just to keep shareholder happy. They are a ticking time bomb.Oh also for the last few years they force retailers to buy some new bikes every year even though they dont change. If the retailers dont buy them they lose their licensing to sell Harleys.So basically all their sales have been made up for the last five or so years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185185.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. people working in a liquor store almost always are drinking on the job.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185186.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. In almost every labor job Ive worked, including being a valet, people smoke and drink on the job. The valet service I worked for never even asked to see my drivers license.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185188.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. The Olive Oil Industry is controlled by the Mafia. In 2007 only 4% of italian olive oil leaving italy was actually pure olive oil. Fake olive oil has the similar profit margins as cocaine trafficking with none of the risk. About 70% of the olive oil that comes into the US is thought to be a fraud.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185189.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Teacher here.Your childs success depends mainly on three things: the childs will, the parents support, and the teachers skill. If your child doesnt want to learn, he wont learn. If you dont f**king feed your child properly, he wont be able to learn. If your child gets his way at home, he will be a terror in class and wont succeed.I am only a part of your childs education. I cant do anything if he refuses to learn or if you refuse to support him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185190.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. I work in lingerie and ladies, theres a 70% chance youre wearing the wrong bra size if you havent been measured in the last 3-6 months. With any weight gain or loss, your breasts are the first thing to fluctuate in size. Also, dont argue after a bra fitting by saying I am NOT that size! Yes, you are. I do this for a living. Please trust that I know how to do my job.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185191.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. If more citizens knew how often U.S. Military individuals said things along the lines of, F**k civilians, they can suck my d**k. People might lose some of their unrelenting support for the troops.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185192.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Im a celebrity event photographer in Hollywood. Most of the smaller award shows winners like the MTV VMAs, Teen Choice Awards, etc...already know they are going to win. This motivates the talent to come to the event. During the show they are backstage talking with friends and take a seat during a commercial break just before their award is announced. The few exceptions are the Oscars and Golden Globes where the audience is mostly celebrities.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87185193.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Concussions. A few years back I taught a student with phenomenal grades. Around midyear, she got concussed playing soccer. Almost failed the school year.

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Pigs. An adult pig is a dangerous animal. Where I live there is always a death by pigs every year.

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Fist fights. One punch is all it takes to get messed up for life, if not die. Fall wrong. Smash your head on something. The punch itself. Plus, you dont even have to be on the receiving end of the punch to mess your life up.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/10/124053/87188114/messuup17.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. “Thomas Midgley Jr. He played a major role in development of tetraethyllead ( leaded gasoline ) which went into mass production throughout the 1920’s. This invention meant that the blood lead content in developing children rose causing numerous problems, including cognitive issues and physical growth, it was also noticed that the rise in blood lead content matched with violence in adolescents in multiple countries. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185816.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Midgley is also accountable for the discovery of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) specifically Freon which as many know had a drastic impact on the Ozone. As of October 2020 the Ozone hole above Antarctica sits approximately 23 million square kilometres /8.9 million miles. Although, these 2 inventions seem insignificant compared to more drastic actions taken by other single humans its the widespread impacts that his inventions had and are still being felt today. Even though both, leaded gasoline and CFC’s, have been banned.” - nat3dog3

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “Trofim Lysenko. A Soviet biologist who thought Gregor Mendel was a reactionary whose thoughts had no place in the Soviet Union. He tried to reinvent agricultural practices to maximize productivity, having farmers put seeds very close together under his belief that plants who belong to the same “class” will not compete for nutrients. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185818.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

He was given the Order of Lenin eight times for his pseudoscience, while his “theories” contributed to the deaths of millions through famines that plagued the USSR. Later he was finally discredited after Stalin’s death, but then Mao Zedong adopted his practices, which helped cause the Great Chinese Famine” - Star_Trekker</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185820.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “Guy de Chauliac. He was a surgeon in the 1300s who vehemently spoke out against another fellow surgeon, Theodoric Borgognoni. Theodoric was a surgeon who wrote about his theories on proper wound care and believed that the best thing you can do to a wound is wrap it and keep it clean. Guy hated what Theodoric was writing because it directly went against the teachings of Galen, an Ancient Greek surgeon who believed pus was the body’s way of balancing your humors. Guy’s teachings were widely accepted and it’s believed that his ignorance set the development of antisepsis in surgery back about 600 years.” - better_than_shane</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185821.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Purportedly, the unnamed inventor of flexible glass (vitrum flexile) brought a drinking bowl made of the material before Tiberius Caesar. The bowl was put through a test to break it, but it merely dented, rather than shattering. The inventor repaired the bowl easily with a small hammer, according to Petronius. After the inventor swore that he was the only man alive who knew the manufacturing technique, Tiberius had the man executed. He feared that the glass would devalue gold and silver, since the material might be more valuable. - catebriga</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185824.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “I would suggest Andrew Wakefield. His work Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children has been directly responsible for the mistrust of vaccines, the decline of Western rates of vaccination, and basically telling everybody that theres a boogeyman underneath your bed.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “Shayk Al-Islam. I heard of this guy after hearing someone on TV complain about how this man set the Islamic world back by centuries. In 1515, the age of the Ottoman Empire, he, a “learned scholar” of the kingdom, issued a decree that forbid printing (press) and made using it punishable by death.” - naman_is</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185827.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. “Yongle Emperor of the Ming Dynasty in China ordered the fleet of Zheng He, the greatest trading and exploration fleet of the time, to be burned during his reign in the early 1400’s. This was the beginning of an era of isolation for Chinese kingdoms, which ultimately lead to the collapse of imperial China, and indirectly to the rise of the PRC. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185828.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

 Additionally, the wealth of the world overall decreased as a result of reduced trade with China, and if China had continued exploring it is possible that they, not Europeans, would have colonized North America (instead of merely maybe discovering it then telling no one as they did in history). It may not be a significant alteration of human progress, but it’s one of those events that sets the world in a definitively different direction.” - nobd7987</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185830.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “Bakhtiyar Khilji. Hands down. In 12th century there was the worlds biggest university in India named Nalanda where intellectuals from all around the world used to study. Then Turks invaded India under Khilji. They killed almost all the intellectuals and destroyed the university. And they BURNT the library. The library continued to burn for 3 MONTHS. This has to be by far the biggest loss to mankind imo.” - SorcererSupreme13</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185831.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “Sir Mark Sykes. This man was the British element in the Sykes-Picot agreement. For those of you not in the know, 100 years ago the Middle-East was an area that did have some nations and some more tribal areas. So people were more divided by language and culture, some by religion. France and Britain decided to carve up the Middle-East into easier to govern territories, but fumbled this task and instead divided the territories on the map OVER these religious and tribal lines. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185832.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

Not only has this been a main contributing cause of conflict in the Middle-East (if you take two opposing or rival groups and then suddenly group them as one country, what do you expect...) but said conflicts have then fueled further conflicts again and again. This has then been further used by Islamic extremists as a reason to hate the western powers, as they were the ones who created this terrible agreement. Even Sykes himself accepted that the agreement’s wording should be changed in order to give those countries autonomous rule. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185833.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

What is a little sad is he actually seemed to want to help these regions with the agreement, but just bumbled the whole thing which has led to most of the issues the Middle-East has to this day. Sykes didnt make the modern Middle-East though, he just played a large part in creating the circumstances in which its current problems thrive. Imagine all of the advancement, education and collaboration that could have happened had the Middle-East been allowed to flourish unhindered and without resentment?” - Lit-Rature</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185835.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Not medical, but dental. Had a woman who was obviously an addict come in for a tooth ache. I had to help her fill out the new patient form because it confused her too much. Every health question was met with ‘what’s that?’. We finally get her back in the room to start X-rays and holy smokes. No wonder this lady had a toothache. She was LITERALLY growing ALGAE on her teeth. It was horrendous. We ended up having to refer her to a dental hospital because the work was so extensive. I couldn’t eat anything with seaweed in it for years. It looked just like the stuff on her teeth.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190074.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. My friend was an ER doctor. Had a guy come in with a flashlight stuck up his b**t. When my friend came back from his break he asked the other doc how the patient with the flashlight up his b**t was doing and the other doc asked him, Which one? It was a busy night!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190075.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. A patient who filled a condom with Hard as Nails (a glue that sets hard as nails) inserted it while the glue was still not set. Then it set and it took every surgical instrument we could think of to extract it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190096.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Found a 6mm fragment of a metal axe in a guys eyelid - he had no idea it was there.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190093.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Too many!

The guy that used tampons as earplugs at night, forgot to take them out and had a shower. He didnt realize how absorbent they were!

The woman complained of a sudden and severe irritation down there. She had sequin knickers and wore them inside out, several of them had come loose and worked their way inside.

The lovely old lady who came in with stabbing pains in the chest, upon inspection we noted that she was indeed being stabbed, by the lamb-chop bone in her bra.

The young lad that had a speculum stuck in his mouth. We dont where/how he got it but apparently, he was trying to pretend to be a duck. (For the guys out there that dont know, a speculum is a medical tool that is most commonly used for examining vaginas).</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190072.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I had a patient that wouldn’t let me take his temperature with a non-contact device on his forehead. He was worried about “blasting radiation into his pituitary gland”. First of all, you’re 90 so I’m sure by now your pituitary gland is a little bag of sand by now; and secondly, where did you get this info? Facebook?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190073.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. A 79-year-old man presents to ER with an aerosol air freshener can up his a**…told the doctor it “slipped in when he went to sit on the toilet…it was so far in there he needed full abdominal surgery to remove it because even the colonoscope couldn’t reach it!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190076.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Had a patient call 9-1-1 with a three-liter coke bottle up his a**.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190077.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. We had a patient who came to the ER after a car accident and had a metal fence pole all the way through his right chest, in the front, out the back. He previously had his right lung removed so he walked away with no injury after a pipe through the chest.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190078.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Not my story but my friend is a paramedic and got called to a house where someone thought a person might be d**d. The guy had hanged himself at least 3 weeks previously. Think advanced state of decomposition. She said she can remember thinking, What do they expect us to do? Resuscitate him?

Obviously, she didnt say anything and just contacted the police. I assume some people just panic and dont know who to call in this situation.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190079.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Before I had a liver transplant, I suffered from a condition called Ascites that makes you retain fluids and your belly looks like you are 11 months pregnant (I am a guy). Every week Id go to the hospital to get the fluids drained (usually around 10 to 11 liters). Since it was a teaching hospital, more often than not there was an attending nurse and a very young doctor.

The procedure required an ultrasound machine, operated by the nurse, and a 9 needle to penetrate the abdomen and find the sack with the liquid. Most young doctors had never done anything like it and they were nervous and a little bit disturbed. Once this very young doctor got physically sick and white as a sheet. He also couldnt find the sack. He kept prodding and getting more and more panicked. By then I was an old hand at it and I had seen it done properly at least a dozen times, so I asked him do you mind if I give it a shot?.

At first, he blabbed something incoherent, so I added, I wont tell anyone, I just cant afford to leave without being drained, this is the one day a week when I get to feel normal for a few hours. He finally agreed and I took hold of the 9 needle. Watching the ultrasound screen, in a few seconds I found the sack and we started filling 2-liter bottles with the liquid.

It was a 12 liters day, requiring six two-liter bottles. My father-in-law drove me there that day, and he was watching the proceedings, but it was too much even for him. He passed out and had to be put on a gurney. Both the doc and my FIL were traumatized. The nurse joked with me about it. I eventually got a liver transplant and that issue went away. I am almost at the 20 years mark.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190080.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I’m the patient here. Guess what I did?

Yeah, I ate a flower with a bee on it. Not only did I get stung, but guess what else?

The flower was the one thing I was allergic to. I couldn’t breathe because I still had a petal AND a bee stuck in my mouth, and my tongue basically blew up. I did not eat any greens, or anything purple because the flower was purple.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190081.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Not me but my dad who was a physician. He said he hated the ER, this was back when there were no ER specialists just doctors on call. I asked him why, and he said he was sick of removing things that had no business being where they were. I said, like what? And he said, like flashlights, baby bottles, and squash. I asked no more.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190082.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. I work in learning disability care and once had to accompany a young lady to the hospital who was complaining about pain when urinating.

Somehow she had inserted peas into her urethra and attempted to fish them out with a bobby pin - over a week before she went to the ED.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190083.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. My wife works in the ICU and a large lady came in once and they had to give her a sponge bath and they found an old oreo under her b**b.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190084.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. A woman came into our ER with a very swollen finger and in a lot of pain. While doing a lot of dishes, a box of spaghetti fell over, as she tried to catch it to avoid it falling into the sudsy sink, one strand impaled itself under her fingernail. Since her hands were so wet, the spaghetti slid all the way to the top of the nail. It. Was. Horrifying. Everyone was cringing! The doctor had to cut a slit into her fingernail to fish it out! We all had funny reactions! The woman said it was so painful that she wanted her finger cut off! She had instant relief when the doc cut the nail and relieved the pressure.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190085.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I once had to explain to a patient that there was no need for us to check his b12 levels because he was actually not on a vegan diet.

Still, he insisted on being a vegan because he only ate poultry regularly, while other meats or fish only a few times a month and also it was always organic. He genuinely thought he was a vegan and therefore needed his b12 level checked.

I ended up saying, b12 deficiency is only a problem for those vegans who dont eat meat.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190086.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Im not a doctor, but I was once in the doctors office waiting for a check-up when this woman bolts in with her young child, screaming that she was bleeding. Her kid was on her period.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190087.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I once handled a man that had inserted the p**is in an active vacuum cleaning pipe, it swelled a lot and got stuck. Totally purple after removal.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190088.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. A Rampant Rabbit in the bowel. Amazing x-ray! Ouch.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190089.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Was on a med-surg-gyn-weird diseases floor. Had a patient come in with Pemphigus. A skin disease. A not often seen one.

Also had a patient come in with a rare genetic disease that both parents were Caucasian, but the baby had very dark skin and hair and their features were Caucasian. He was also in a wheelchair and his skin was very delicate and broke down easily. Can’t remember the name of it, De. … something. But it was very interesting.

I also had several patients with cystic fibrosis, under this one doctor’s care. They aged from teens to 36. Very old for a patient with CF. He was very invested in their care. One patient came in and he was dying. He asked that any nurse not comfortable with his morphine dosing schedule, not take care of his patient. He was of the opinion, that they could pretty much tell you when and how much they wanted or needed, and where to get it. He later was in the news as the doctor who broke the genetic code for CF. He was based in Orlando, Fl. He was an amazing doctor!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190090.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. P**is fish…. A fish swam up into this man’s urethra. He had been on vacation and WAITED UNTIL HE WAS BACK to get looked at!!! That was nearly 20 years ago and I will never forget that poor guy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190091.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Not a doctor. Sat in the waiting room at the health center, waiting for my doctor when a worker from the building project next door came in. He had his hand wrapped in a big towel and just stood in the line for the receptionist.

He left a large trail of blood running from the towel. Not dripping, running in a small stream. Luckily someone more or less shouted to get him some attention. When a couple of nurses came running the dude said something like: I just cut myself a bit, not really seeming to realize it had to be bad. Either he was cool as a cucumber or in chock. Probably the latter.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190092.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. I had a severely psychotic patient who was convinced she had consumed human flesh and was always trying to induce vomiting. She was eventually discharged. Later she was re-admitted when her relative (a new mother) had caught this patient preparing to eat the baby.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190094.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. As a paramedic with over 25 years in the job, I have witnessed a lot of things.

One that sticks with me is a call I dealt with over 20 years ago. A lady dialed 999 and the call was passed as broken finger. It was only when we arrived we found that she had actually broken a fingernail, and was wanting us to fix it as she was going to a dinner party and wanted to look her best. For context, the patient lived in a large house with a private drive and considered herself to be in the upper class.

My crew mate did indeed fix the broken fingernail back on, with a big comedy bandage you would normally expect to see in a cartoon. Our patient was not impressed by this, as it made her look ridiculous, and she uttered that immortal line I will get you sacked for this.

My crew mate, being less subtle than me, educated the lady on the inappropriateness of the situation (in words of very few syllabus) and it would be a shame if we did get sacked and details of this call leaked to the press. I dont believe a complaint was ever made...</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190097.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. I work registration in the emergency room…I’ve seen some weird stuff in the month and a half I’ve been here. We had one woman come in with a lit cigarette and a newborn…she had given birth in her car, and decided to wait to come in so she could finish smoking.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190098.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. Saw this guy who ‘accidentally’ injected an EpiPen into his junk.

He got worried and came into the ED. He claimed it was totally an accident and just wanted to see how the thing worked, but his friend told us he was out of viagra and wanted to see if the EpiPen works as a replacement, since it’s epinephrine/adrenaline.

Spoiler alert, it doesn’t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190099.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Urgent care registration staff here. Had a man come in because he needed a boil on his arm checked out. I didnt ask him to, but he unzipped his jacket (no shirt on underneath) and showed me his arms. This was NOT just a boil, he had rubber surgical drains coming out multiple sites on each arm.

He had left an out-of-state hospital where he was being treated for purulent cellulitis without notifying doctors or getting his Rx for antibiotics. He said he had to get to Montana for a friends funeral and didnt have time to stop long. Our doctors told him his case was too severe and he needed to go to the ER because he was septic. He refused an ambulance ride and said hed drive himself. We checked hospital records later that day and the man never checked in at the ER. He just continued his drive across state lines.

Maybe there were eventually 2 funerals in Montana that day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87190100.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Family vlog channels. There’s been many instances where families have exposed intimate inappropriate parts of a child’s upbringing, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there are legal cases in the future for exploitation or damages. I’d say it will be age-restricted at least since the kids can’t consent.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87188388.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I believe it is currently legal in 30 states for doctors to do pelvic exams on unconscious women without their consent for “educational and teaching purposes”.

## <a href="#linky18" id="linky17">8 Things Your Body Might Be Hiding From You</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Whenever a drop in temperature on the palate occurs, the brain jumps into action to prevent freezing to death. In other words, the brain will increase blood pressure in an effort to tell the person to slow down a notch. This condition is called an ice cream headache. And it’s something we should all watch out for during summer days.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188088.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. This might sound like a cliché, but stress can literally change the shape of your heart. Takotsubo syndrome is a condition that causes the left ventricle to change shape and fail to pump blood properly. During short-term stress, 2 molecules known to be released during stress and depression can affect the activity of heart muscle cells, leading to a temporary failure. Luckily, managing stress and practicing breathing and meditation techniques cure this condition without the need for medication.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188089.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The human microbiome, also known as the gut environment, is an ecosystem made of various bacteria that have co-evolved with humans to benefit both the host and the bacteria. This bacterium is known to influence human psychology since it contains a profound number of chemicals that are used by our neurons to communicate and regulate mood, like dopamine and serotonin. Speaking of which, 95% of the body’s supply of serotonin is produced in the gut.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188091.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. The white matter is the tissue that connects neurons together, making communication possible between the various gray matter regions and between the gray matter and the rest of the body. As we age, our white matter degrades, resulting in symptoms like memory loss and difficulty solving problems.

But research has shown that dancing increases white matter in the brain, which increases cognitive function and keeps the brain in shape. And of course, it’s hard to be unhappy when you’re dancing. So it’s a win-win situation.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188090.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. As we grow older, our bodies shrink, but our noses and ears keep getting bigger. This happens because our skin starts to lose its elasticity and can’t retain the support that it once could. The nose and ears are no exceptions.

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Exposing the skin to black light, also known as Wood’s light, can be used to detect bacterial and fungal skin infections as well as irregularities in skin pigmentation. Under a Wood’s lamp, healthy skin glows brightly without shining. It may display white spots when the skin is thick, yellow spots where the skin is greasy, and purple patches where the skin is dry.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87188087.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
