<span style="font-size:4em">23. The Duke lacrosse guys. Rich, over privileged white frat bros who beat and raped a black stripper they had hired to perform at their frat party. Because of course they did, it was obvious. Lock em up and throw away the key.Except it never happened. The woman made it all up. They were presumed guilty, and were treated as such by the media.Charges were eventually dropped, but not before the accused and sustained extreme damage to their names, reputations, and, surely, mental health. Eventual fallout would include the prosecutor getting disbarred for fraud, and Duke University settling with the guys for $20 million each. The stripper? Several years later, she would be arrested and convicted of murder after stabbing her boyfriend to death. Yea, its unrelated, but its a lso a window into the kind of person she is.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87131027.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">15 Hilarious Things Kids Have Asked Their Teachers</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. The time a fourth grader asked me to show him my dong. Loudly. In front of his entire class. I’m a music teacher. And a female. He meant he wanted to see a gong. - urbancowgirl42</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129197.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. One child called another lil hot dog and the victim was utterly distraught. I somehow managed to convince him I was crying because its such a mean thing to call someone. - insignismemoria</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129198.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. My first year teaching, I was going over the parts of a parabola. So I had my boring ole parabola up and I drew a dot at the vertex. Some kid goes, that is the easy one to remember, its the nipple of the titty. I had to keep facing the board for a bit so push back the smile. - Makenshine</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129199.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. We were playing a phonics game. There were two teams; one person from each team had to say a rhyming word of the word that I said. I said “pick”, a student said “dick”. I’m thankful the rest of the class didn’t know what that was. - uwubutcuter</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129200.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Field trip instructor. I was leading a discussion on food chains with some 4th graders and asked what we call animals that only eat plants. The answer I got was virgins. - Evolving_Dore</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129201.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I had a kid who got extremely angry because I told him that he couldn’t do something (don’t remember what). He started stomping and screaming and became so angry that he dropped his pants and stood there in his underwear glaring at me. I wanted to laugh so bad but it would have just pissed him off more and that would not have helped the situation. - talibob</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129202.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I’m a history teacher. We were looking in the textbook at a section on the founding fathers. Several of them had their own subheadings and a little paragraph about them. Like this: George Washington (1732-1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), Benjamin Franklin (1707-1790), I then have a student raise their hand and ask, completely serious, “If you call these numbers, do they still work?” She thought their birth and death dates were their phone numbers. I teach high school, the class lost their shit, and it took everything in me to keep a straight face. - snapdown91</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129203.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I teach English to Japanese kids, alongside a native Japanese teacher, and one day they asked me the English word for 白菜 (hakusai), which I now know is like, Chinese cabbage or napa cabbage, but I didnt know at the time and ended up using google translate on the big PC screen in the front of the class. For some reason, the English traslation came up as white rape (???) and I guess the Japanese teacher mistook my baffled reaction as an inability to prounce the word or something, because before I knew it he hit the lil audio button and white rape was being spoken aloud to the whole class. It was such a surreal moment and I was the only one in the room that could appreciate the absurdity. I had to just play it off like, Uhhhh, nope, thats not it! Lets uhh, lets just move on... Pretty sure that memory will be in my life review when I die. - atttaraxia</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129207.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12.

I only said FUCK I didnt say *looks around and starts to whisper* ...you... I was like, No, no! Thats not the bad word, its the other one!, but I was dying, I had to turn around and go laugh behind a corner. - nickbkk</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129208.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. We were doing a lab testing density of objects - including wooden, rubber, and styrofoam balls.

## <a href="#linky4" id="linky3">15 People Who Had the Worst Neighbors Imaginable </a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. My asshole neighbors are actually fine to me. A very old woman lives there and her step-brother uses the location to sell drugs. His clientele are not nice.

<span style="font-size:4em">

As of late, Ive been finding nails, screws, and scrap metal in the driveway past where they ever drive their vehicles. I try to avoid conflict, but its starting to get out of hand. As of yesterday, I installed a trail cam in hopes that they will stop being assholes. Time will tell if that actually works. - stealyourfaced</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129271.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

This one day Im working on my motorbike out in the shared car park, when the mother turned up in her Ford Ka and parked next to my parents car. She got out of her car and proceeded to smash her car door into my parents about 8 or 9 times while smiling at me. Her nickname was Psycho Sally for a reason. - slawter_uk</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129274.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Had a neighbor leave a note on my then-girlfriends car saying she wasnt allowed to park in front of their house because their taxes paid for that part of the street. That same neighbor constantly called the cops on me for trivial things like one time I was shoveling my driveway and I moved my car onto the sidewalk for 5 minutes while I shoveled the spot where it was previously parked. Pretty much every discussion I had with the cops involved the cop making fun of how stupid the people were for calling to complain. - DobRex</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129275.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I convinced myself that I could really walk and it was just mind over matter, and despite my boyfriend and friends telling me not to, I rose up from my wheelchair and promptly fell under the pub table. I was covered in bruises, and I had a sore bum for days.

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Not dumbest but laziest. I microwaved something and when I opened the door to get it, because it wasnt centered on the turning plate, it was a bit further from the door.

Every time I move I hear a sound like there is an animal stalking me in the many bushes in my backyard. Whenever I stop the sound stops but once I start moving again it sounds to me like the leaves in the bushes in our backyard are rustling and there is an animal in them. If I try to go back toward my back door the sound follows me. If I move further into the backyard the sound follows me.
