<span style="font-size:4em">2. Everyone has a story from their childhood that still pisses them off, this is mine.
I was five years old and my snotty older cousin was over at our house. I had just gotten a copy of Mike Tyson’s Punch out for my birthday. He was getting his butt kicked by king hippo and he got so angry he rage quit. But he didn’t just rage quit, he ripped the cartridge out of the Nintendo and spit into it. Then he threw it across the room and stormed out.

I told my parents what happened and they told his parents and they made him apologize, but the game was ruined. It would kind of play, but would freeze up all the time. My family barely had enough money to get me the game for my birthday never mind buying it again. I was sure I would never be able to play it again.

<span style="font-size:4em">3. My in-laws hated me. We invited them over for thanksgiving dinner and, upon arrival, they asked me to leave and come back a few hours later because they wanted to “follow their tradition of preparing the meal alone as a family.” They are now my ex-in-laws.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87195598.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I had just moved into a new house. I invited my one friend over for celebratory drinks cause hey, I just got a house. Things were going great, we were tipsy and having fun. My boyfriend was coming home so I made her a bed on my pull out couch. Boyfriend came home and we all went to bed. Around 2 am he heard rustling around, he thought nothing of it. He just assumed she was drunk and playing with the cats. I woke up around 4am and got a bad feeling and woke up my boyfriend.

<span style="font-size:4em">
We went upstairs and noticed the bed hadn’t even been touched. Pillows and blankets still folded. I turned the lights on and noticed my front door was open and all the cats were gone. Further more into looking around we noticed his wallet was open and over a $100 in money had been taken out, our change bowl was empty and his Xbox and brand new elite Xbox controller was gone, as well as my laptop. She stole his medicinal marijuana and broke glasses .I called her freaking out and she said “I left cause I didn’t want to hear you doing it (which we never had) and she let my cat out to run away because she didn’t like cats. She then proceeded to say my partner was a jerk who was cheating on me (she had never met him until that night).

We called the cops. She denied stealing anything. I messaged her fiancé saying what she had done and what she had stolen, he messaged me text screenshots of her asking how much she could get for his Xbox and Xbox elite controller, thus proving she did steal it. Sent all these screenshots to the cops and they went to her house a couple times and eventually find her hiding in there not answering the door on purpose. She got charged with petty theft and they found out she committed fraud against her fiancé and her dad. It was a total nightmare.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87195575.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I was a kid probably 9 or 10 and my mom had a friend and her son over for lunch. The kid disappeared for about 10 minutes, and at the time I thought he had gone to the bathroom cause i really had to go. So when he came back I quickly maneuvered my way past him into the room before the bathroom, where we had a fish tank. This would be completely irrelevant if the fish tank wasnt cloudy and swirling about. At first glance I didnt know what it was until I noticed smashed and ripped apart pieces of little fish faces moving around in the swirl. The kid reached into the fish tank and squeezed the ever loving life out of every single fish in that tank.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87195581.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I’m pissed just typing this even though it has been years. Some of my wife’s family came to visit. The idea was that on their way to the Smokey mountains they would stop and visit with us for a day or two since we seldom see each other and our house is on the way. Turns out that was total BS, they just wanted to use our house as a free hotel. Which, to a degree, is fine. I don’t mind lending a room to a family member.

<span style="font-size:4em">
But they were not even remotely cool about it. First, they called and asked if we could have something for them to eat because it would be late when they arrived and had no time to stop. So I decided I would make a lasagna since I’m kind of known for that in the family. So I spent like $60 and several hours to make two big pans of lasagna since it would have to feed several people. They showed up with chic-fil-a bags and said they had already eaten.

Then they went immediately to their rooms upstairs, not to sleep but to watch TV (which is in the bedroom) without hardly saying a thing to us besides “hi hows it going”. Then in the middle of the night one of them got cold and turned the thermostat up to like 77 degrees which means the heater ran non stop for hours and hours and we woke up damn near in a sweat. When they woke up they asked if I normally cook breakfast. I said no, not on weekdays because I have to go to work. They gave dejected looks so I was like, fine, I can make breakfast. Would you guys like waffles or eggs and bacon? They said eggs so I made a metric ton of eggs and bacon and left it for them because I had to go to work.

When I got home they hadn’t even touched the food I made, the kitchen was an absolute disaster because they decided they wanted waffles instead and helped themselves, without even asking, dirtying every damn dish in the house and ruining my waffle iron because they left it on until it auto shut off but by then had burned the batter until it was fused to the thing and the whole house reeked of burnt waffles for two days. They also clearly scratched my wife’s car as they left because it was in the driveway and coincidentally had huge scratch where maroon paint had rubbed off and guess what color their van was. I asked them about it and they said they had no idea how it got there.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87195588.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

All the time the mum and my mum were standing and talking, and the daughter was walking around touching everything, opening all the containers, looking in, playing with things... And the mum acted like she didnt see a thing. The daughter opened a container above our piano, and pulled out sheets of stickers. MY stickers.
