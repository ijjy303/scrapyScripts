Roosevelt wrote of Lilly:

“There is a white hunter, Ben Lily [sic], who has just joined us who is a really remarkable character. He literally lives in the woods. … He had tramped for twenty-four hours through the woods, without food or water, and had slept a couple of hours in a crooked tree, like a turkey. He has a wild, gentle face, with blue eyes and full beard; he is a religious fanatic and is as hardy as a bear or elk, literally caring nothing for fatigue and exposure which we couldn’t stand at all. … He was particularly fond of the chase of the bear, which he followed by himself with one or two dogs; often he would be on the trail of his quarry for days at a time, lying down to sleep wherever night overtook him.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87182243.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. In 1931 Albert Einstein sent a letter to Sigmund Freud titled Why War? to better understand the psychological causes of war. Freud responded that biological evolution, inherent power differences within groups, and the paradox of peace (times of peace allow empires to be built) cause war.

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Golds yellow color and inertness are explained by Einstein’s theory of relativity. Golds electrons travel so close to the speed of light that relativity contracts some of their orbits. This shrinks an energy gap so it absorbs blue light, and makes the outer electron less reactive.

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Einsteins view of gravity is not a force of attraction between matter, but a natural consequence of curved space and time caused by mass. Einsteins extraordinary claim is that there is no force of attraction between the Earth and moon; it is simply the moon following curved spacetime.

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Robert Millikan disliked Einsteins results about light consisting of particles (photons) and carefully designed experiments to disprove them, but ended up confirming the particle nature of light, and earned a Nobel Prize for that.

<span style="font-size:4em">19. There is an official world record for time traveling. Its held by cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who has spent 803 days total in orbit around Earth. According to Einsteins theories of relativity, this would mean Sergei effectively has travelled about 0.02 seconds forward in time.

<span style="font-size:4em">20. As a child, Einsteins Uncle Jakob introduced him to algebra and called it a merry science. He compared algebra to hunting a little animal. You didnt know the name of the animal, so you called it x. When you finally caught the animal you gave it the correct name
