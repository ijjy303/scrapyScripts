## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">25 Awesome Jobs That Actually Suck</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I strongly suspect being a spy doesnt involve half as many high-tech gadgets and spontaneous sexual intercourse as Ive been led to believe.

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Anything in modern-day publishing. How many television shows and movies must I watch where the plucky young upstart graduates from college and gets a job at the magazine or newspaper of their choice and is respected and can make a living?

The pay sucks, youre in constant danger of being laid off (when your pub folds, usually), and its usually a pretty corporate environment where youre tasked with multiple jobs for little hope of advancement. The names high up on the mastheads are usually those of rich people, and its because they started off rich and could afford to stay in the industry.

<span style="font-size:4em">3. From what Ive understood, being a cowboy was (is?) really awful.

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Working on a film. If youre crew, it sucks. long long hours for what seems like very very slow progress on the picture, lots of standing around waiting, etc. You arrive well before everyone else and leave after everyone else. If this is an indie production you also may have to beg/chase down for your pay at the end of each week. Oh, and when the film wraps, youre now unemployed.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Being a therapist. Too many people Ive met get into the field thinking its how they saw it on TV: affluent white collar, own office, warm slow pace environment, where you get to sit on a nice comfy couch and be like lets talk about your feelings. Thats only if you get to private practice, which they dont tell you is also like running your own small business, which good luck is you have no business acumen.

The reality is you get out of grad school, get your first job working at a Community Mental Health facility because they are the only ones who will hire you with a limited license and no experience, getting paid less than $40k/yr if youre lucky, and then get put in a walk-in closet of an office, where they dump 100 client caseload on you the first day. Followed by your first client who has 5 different diagnoses and is on 12 different psych meds who says to you f*ck you, youre the 7th different person Ive had here, nobody cares about me. Yeah people go into $100k of debt for that...

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Archaeologist, specifically field archaeology. 99% of the time you find absolutely nothing, its often physically demanding (sometimes grueling), the pay is sh*t, there are no benefits, you have to constantly travel, theres very little stability, I could go on.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Lawyer. Number of historic, life-changing, precedent-setting cases participated in: 0. Number of angry, self entitled, abusive clients wanting to screw each other over: 842. Number of pages of paperwork that’s sucked up free time and social life: 84,836.

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Everyone used to think it was awesome that I worked in live sports TV. 70% of the people I worked with were miserable pricks with over-inflated egos, and then there were the athletes…

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Apparently, lifeguards, because nobody can find them anymore.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Anything in the music industry. Youre never really off the clock, the pay is terrible pretty much all across the board unless youre in the 1% of the top in any business. People think its all glamorous because they see the popstars, the music videos, the award shows. Truth is, its blood, sweat, tears, stress, lack of sleep, a lot of inappropriate behaviour, drugs (fun if you like it, not fun if you dont), alcohol (again: fun if you like it, not fun if you dont.) 
</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217918.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
And again: low pay, and then maybe once or twice a year you get a perk of going to an award show with free food, booze and a chance to say Hi to some celebs (cant even take a photo with them, really, as its not deemed professional in a work setting). Ive been there for 15 years give or take, branched out, still linked to it in some ways but I get my money (much better money, might I say) elsewhere now and without as much stress or worry.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Most (not all) jobs in the environmental sector. Pay is usually quite low, you tend to work in very ugly places (landfills, contaminated sites). You are expected to get jobs done in half the time you really need with as few resources as possible. And if you are consulting for other companies, nobody really wants to be working with you to “save the environment” - they generally are just trying to barely meet some regulations.
 
-u/waldo_92</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217921.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Anything that requires a lot of travel. Sounds glamorous but in reality, all you see is usually an airport, conference room, boring hotel room, and maybe a restaurant if you are lucky. It’s exhausting and it actually just sucks.
 
-u/Electronic_Crab_8955</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217922.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Computer game development, especially testing. That is the a** end of an industry that is mostly a**.

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Journalist. Expectation: I’m gonna be the next Hunter S. Thompson and write compelling feature pieces with a unique voice and get paid to travel the world! Reality: Talking to my editor about how my contact from the cat fashion show won’t call me back or do an interview unless we pay them $80 or adopt two cats.

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Architect. You think you’ll be designing big fancy iconic buildings. Warehouses, Walmarts, strip malls, and sh*t box apartments all need architects and that’s probably what you’ll end up doing.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Health insurance plans that charge 500-1000 a month just to be insured, then dont start covering your bills until youve paid another 2000-10,000 out of pocket....and even THEN will still make you pay a 45 dollar copay. And on the provider end, your plan is delaying payment on claims so your 500-1000 dollar a month premium is just going into the pocket of the executives and shareholders instead of health care providers. And behavioral health claims get most of the abuse (just in case you were wondering why so many licensed psychotherapists opt out of accepting insurance) - DetachmentStyles</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87216083.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">25 Alexander the Great Facts Your Teachers Never Told You</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. The body of Alexander the Great has been lost over time. It was well-known to be in Alexandria, Egypt for centuries, and was even worshiped for a while, but its exact location has apparently been forgotten.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217534.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. As a student of Aristotle, Alexander the Great was said to be a philosopher king, that is, a ruler who possessed both a love of wisdom, as well as intelligence, reliability, and a willingness to live a simple life. Such a king was the ideal ruler in Platos fictional utopian city of Kallipolis.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217536.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. When Alexander the Great defeated Darius III at Issus, Darius fled leaving his entire family to Alexander, including his mother Sisygambis. Alexander treated them well, and when Darius was killed Sisygambis did not mourn her son: I have only one son [Alexander] and he is king of all Persia.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217538.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Today I learned about Cynane, Alexander the Greats warrior half-sister. Unlike most women of the time, she was given a martial education, and led her own troops into battle. She slew an Illyrian queen in battle, defeated the army of one of Alexanders generals, and after she was killed by Alcetas, his troops rioted.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217532.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Centuries after Alexander the greats death, his tomb was a tourist attraction. Many of the Roman emperors who visited the tomb left with souvenirs, effectively looting the monument. According to one account, Augustus Caesar tried to touch the 300-year-old mummy, accidentally breaking its nose.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217533.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Alexander the Great once suffered an arrow wound that pierced his lung. He fought on as long as he could, but eventually collapsed on his shield. His army was able to protect him long enough to win the battle and to escape. They cut the arrow out of his chest and amazingly he fully recovered.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217535.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Alexander the Great encouraged his men to shave, so that enemies couldnt grab their beards during combat.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217546.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Alexander the Great once built a half-mile causeway through the sea to capture the impregnable Tyre island. The island has remained a peninsula ever since.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217537.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. In 346BC, Alexander the Great, at the age of 10, after taming a large anxious horse, was allowed to buy it. He named the horse Bucephalas, and he rode the horse until the Battle of Hydapes in 326BC when it died at the age of 30. Alexander later named a city after his steed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217539.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Roman historian Livy argued that Rome would have beaten Alexander the Great if he had lived long enough to attack the Romans. His digression is the oldest known alternate history.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217540.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Although Cleopatra was born in Egypt, she wasnt necessarily Egyptian. Her family origins come from Macedonian Greece and Ptolemy I Soter, one of Alexander the Great’s generals.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217541.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Alexander the Great arranged a mass wedding for his Macedonian soldiers to marry Persian women to unite the regions called the Susa Wedding. After Alexander died, all the men except two divorced their Persian wives.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217542.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Aristotle was Alexander the Greats private tutor and from his teachings developed a love of science, particularly of medicine and botany. Alexander included botanists and scientists in his army to study the many lands he conquered.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217531.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. When Alexander the Great’s dearest friend Hephaestion died, Alexander threw him a lavish funeral worth around £1,500,000,000. He also had a 60-meter-high pyre commissioned, with 7 layers of golden objects. Hephaestion was also worshiped as a divine hero. Shrines were erected in his memory.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217543.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Afghanistans second-largest city, Kandahar, was founded by Alexander the Great.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217544.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. When Alexander the Great was invading India, he learned of a Brahmin who lived in the woods. He visited him and the Brahmin replied, You will soon be dead, and then you will own just as much of this earth as will suffice to bury you. Alexander approved of this sentiment and left him in peace.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217545.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Before a key battle in Alexander the Greats campaign in Persia, the Persian king offered Alexander generous terms for peace. One of Alexanders generals is said to have remarked: I would accept the terms, if I were you. Alexander responded: So would I, if I were you. He won.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217547.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Afghanistan shares a 46-mile border with China. Marco Polo used it in his Silk Road travels. Its rumored to have a fort Alexander the Great was not able to conquer, and it has one of the largest untouched copper mines in the world.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217548.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Alexander the Great feed his troops licorice to quench thirst, sustain them in long marches, and help with their health.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217549.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Alexander the Greats invasion led to Greek-speaking Buddhist kingdoms in present-day Afghanistan. This led to Greek influences on Buddhist art, for example the Buddha being depicted in a flowing robe (from the Greek himation, similar to a toga). Before this, he was shown wearing a loincloth.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217550.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Alexander the Great held Cyrus in such high esteem that when he discovered that Cyrus tomb had been ransacked upon conquering the capital city, he personally paid to have it completely restored to its former glory down to the smallest detail and appointed his own guards to watch over it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217551.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Apelles, an ancient Greek painter, was considered by many, including Pliny, to be the greatest artist in the world. Pliny recorded that Alexander the Great so admired Apelless work that he gave his concubine to him. Today, none of Apelless original works have survived.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217552.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Alexander the Great was 22 when he was granted generalship and began his conquest on the Persian (Achaemenid) Empire.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217553.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Alexander the Great killed his friend in a drunken rage by throwing a javelin through his chest during an argument.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217554.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. During the Battle of Issus, while pursuing the fleeing Persian king Darius III, Alexander the Great and his men filled a ravine in with dead Persian soldiers in order to continue their chase.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217555.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
