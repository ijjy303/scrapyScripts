<span style="font-size:4em">1. “I was working at a hospital as an Intern. There was a woman who had a brain Tumor a while a go. She got in for a check up, six months pregnant and having depression. The doctor thought he found a new Tumor so she had another brain operation. But there was no Tumor and they cut her head open for nothing. And after she woke up they didn’t tell her this, instead acted like they removed it successfully.” -123diesdas</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174485.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “When I worked for State IT, we werent supposed to provide details of what hardware was being used or operating systems. In the nineties, I took on an old server, souped it up, and put Linux on it to run our networks. This was pretty radical at the time because everyone else was using something proprietary (Like Netware) and I was able to deliver services for free (email and samba) they were paying out the nose for. The NDA wasnt about security. It was about keeping how much money they were wasting under wraps.” -jamessavik</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174474.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

You know, that you’re getting what you paid for.” -cobra_mist</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174478.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

I told them that I was but it was a big pay cut and I understood if they left and would be happy to write them a letter of recommendation.


They all stayed. I was an under an NDA that precluded me from telling them that there were about 5 of us out of the 50 that all kept our previous pay rate. They obviously assumed that I was taking a pay cut with them by staying. Im pretty sure that NDA wouldnt hold up in court, but I didnt know that at the time. It felt sleazy as fuck to treat my guys that way.” - DorkHonor</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174486.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">The Most Unprofessional Things Doctors Have Ever Said</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I went to the doctors to get my breasts checked (he basically just held and caressed them in a manner he wouldnt have had a chance to feel anything potentially dangerous) and due to them causing me a lot of physical pain I asked him about my options regarding breast reduction surgery. He got visibly angry and told me to never even think about it, and called them beautiful and tender. He was well in his 50s and I was 18-19. I paid like 50 dollars for master roshi to ignore my health issues and make me find another doctor who actually wanted to help people. -u/bratsbane</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173795.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Had a bad head injury when I was a kid (12 or 13) and saw a bunch doctors trying to figure out what was wrong. Got a little snippy with one of them over something I don’t even remember. Pulled up the medical record years later and she referred to me as a “child of the devil” in her report. Had to make some phone calls to get that “diagnosis” removed from my record. -u/DuckSkrol</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173796.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Had a doctor in the 80s tell my mom my severe life-threatening disease, was not real because theres no real evidence that there is a genetic basis for disease. Despite my genetic disease being well studied.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Unprofessional, but funny. I had taken my 92-year-old mother to a recheck appointment to her PCP. An apparently new medical assistant was dutifully getting her history by reading off a checklist. When she asked when Moms last period was, I looked at Mom a little nervously. She was VERY old school, very dignified and would typically never acknowledge to her sons that she had female parts.

I saw a rare twinkle in Moms eyes as she calmly replied, well, I cant give you an exact number of months, but Im pretty sure it was sometime in the late 1960s. The assistant had the good grace to laugh with us, apologize, then read the next question.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. When I was in junior high, I went out for the basketball team. I had to take a physical and it had to be done by the schools doctor and not my own. I went in to do the physical and had to get naked. I did so and the doctor looked me over. He saw that I have an inverted breast bone and said Wow. That is freakish. You cant be on the team with that. I know that my breast bone makes it look like I have a hole in my chest, but I had never been self-conscious about it until that moment.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Because this examination was taking place in the boys locker room in front of other kids wanting to go out for the team too, everyone started laughing at me and calling me names. I grabbed my sh*t and left. My mother took me to our regular doctor who reassured me that there was nothing wrong with me and that there are plenty of people who have breast bones just like mine. It didnt help but I appreciated that she explained it to me. I stopped taking off my shirt in front of others. I was harassed and bullied by my entire classic for years to come because a doctor made a comment that he shouldnt have made. -u/jimmypfromthe5thgala</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87173808.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8.

I ended up getting rushed into resuscitation a few weeks later with a punctured lung that caused a one-way valve in my lung where air could escape into my chest cavity but not get back out. Because it was brushed off/not properly investigated it caused a life-threatening condition called Tension Pneumothorax where the pressure that had built up over time on one side of my chest caused my lung to collapse completely and started crushing my heart and other lung, and compressing/bending the arteries, veins, and esophagus in my neck.
