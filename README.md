## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">Popular Things in the Media That Are Actually Propaganda</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I love the show Law and Order, but I have to wonder how much damage its done to our public view of police officers. On the show, if someone takes the 5th, theyre guilty. If a cop beats up a suspect, they were guilty. Heck, if they shoot them, interrogate them hard, frame them, lie to them, hack their personal computers, etc... its all okay, because theyre guilty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125408/87179995/propoganda1.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Undercover Boss. At this point, any worker should know if they see a middle aged white guy or woman with a bad wig, make up, and a camera crew behind them should be able to figure out theyre on Undercover Boss.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125419/87179996/propoganda4.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Feel good stories, like “8 year old kid saves up $3000 by working to help sister afford her surgery.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125430/87179997/propoganda5.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. America’s Got Talent. It promotes the idea that talent goes hand in hand with struggle, so much so that genuinely awful acts make it through on the strength of their sob story.People have a hard enough time accepting the work that goes into being a creative without having to attach a tragic backstory to it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125438/87179998/propoganda3.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Business articles on LinkedIn that talk about how people should stop seeking work/life balance and start embracing work/life integration.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125438/87179999/propoganda2.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Superhero movies are endorsements of extrajudicial punishment.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125441/87180000/propoganda6.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Any modern war movie featuring real military equipment. To get access to the equipment, they need to work with the Department of Defense. For them to allow it, they need to approve the script. For them to approve the script, the movie needs to give a positive portrayal of the military.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125452/87180002/propoganda9.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. The movie, Reefer Madness. Terrible movie, but hilarious today.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125502/87180003/propoganda10.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. The entire cop show genre. It goes back to the radio drama days and spans drama, comedy, infotainment, documentary, and multiple other genres, but it almost always presents the police as being the white-hatted Good Guys out to stop the Bad Guys.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125504/87180004/propoganda7.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Walmart radio. I worked at Walmart for 3 months and I realized that it seems to be designed to be tuned out by shoppers. It’s real purpose is to brainwash employees and get into their heads so they believe all of the “we’re a family” crap.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125513/87180005/propoganda12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Any news targeting stock owners. Not the big companies, but the private people who have a few thousand dollars worth or less. The way it works is that a scandal comes out and is designed to make people panic and sell, swinging the price down by a lot, sometimes half the price. Then big companies buy up billions of dollars worth and this swings the price back up. Then they sell it again making a fortune.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125516/87180006/propoganda11.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. The Internship (2013). Just Wedding Crashers but taken over by our Google overlords. Praise be.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125524/87180007/propoganda13.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. I love Top Gun. Its a huge guilty pleasure of mine and I cant wait to see Maverick in theaters. That being said, it is 1000% propaganda for the Navy, to the point where the Navy had a lot of say in the script and they set up recruitment booths outside the theater.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125528/87180008/propoganda14.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. American Sniper. I’m still mad that I got tricked into thinking it was a movie about PTSD.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125535/87180009/propoganda15.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Drug ads. Our advertisements pushing drugs for every single ailment are just propaganda for big pharma.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125550/87180012/propoganda18.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. French soldiers in a bayonet charge, up a steep slope in the Argonne Forest in 1915.

Combined casualties came to more than 215,000 from this battle alone.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87174913.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Six German soldiers pose in a in trench with machine gun, a mere 40 meters from the British line.
The machine gun appears to be a Maschinengewehr 08, or MG 08, capable of firing 450-500 rounds a minute. The large cylinder is a jacket around the barrel, filled with water to cool the metal during rapid fire. The soldier at right, with gas mask canister slung over his shoulder, is peering into a periscope to get a view of enemy activity.

<span style="font-size:4em">13. An experimental Red Cross vehicle designed to protect the wounded while gathering them from trenches during World War I, ca. 1915.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I used to write on cakes, the worst name I ever saw was Tuba Poo. I asked if it was a nickname, it was not. Its been like 6 years and it still haunts me. Her mothers name was Natalie, why Natalie? Why?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177391.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. A co-worker has a friend who named her daughters Vengeance and Violence.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177392.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. The overly matchy names to the point of ridiculousness. My top example is a set of brothers named Romance, Romantic, and Romeo.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177393.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Back when I worked with children, I met a young lass named Younique. I felt sorry for her. She was only 4-5 at the time, and the moment she entered school, she began to hate it because the other children thought that it was silly and wouldn’t play with her. Eventually, the dad of another child said that it was a bad name *to her face.* Seriously. Don’t do things like this to your children. They aren’t pets. They’ll have to deal with the repercussions of your bad naming choices.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177381.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Someone I know is a nurse in the ER so theyve delivered quite a few babies. But one day they said that one set of parents decided to name their kid Ssss. You pronounce Ssss, Forest.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177394.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Baby. As in the Dirty Dancing lead female. Because nobody in the professional world is going to want their name to be Baby.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177395.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Kash. It isnt the worst name in the world but the fact his second name was Ransom, made it a whole lot worse.

Kash Ransom.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177396.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Saw a fun name on the attendance sheet (so this is official) of one of my classes: Daddyboi</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177397.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. MyLuv (yes, I have met a kid named this). That poor kid is probably not going to be successful, unless they change their name later on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177398.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I went to high school with a one Crystal Shanda Lear.

This was back before dumb names were the rage. She would have been named that in, say, 81-82. Poor girl. I dont know that I lost respect for the parents so much as felt bad for her to be saddled with that s**t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177399.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. I lose respect for parents who give their kids first names that when added to their given last names become horrible. The parents dont even care that their kid has to live with it. Two real examples Ive come across are Richard Sieman (The guys name is D**k Semen, for f***s sake.) And even worse, Desire Cox.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177400.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Anaesthasia. No s**t. Her name on her school documents was Anaesthasia.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177401.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. One of my former employees had the first name “Baby Destiny.” Yes. Really.

Worse still, HR just put “Baby” on her name badge. For every time I had to catch myself and say the full name so I didn’t sound like a creep, I can only imagine how many other people didn’t realize there were two words in her name and had to refer to her as just Baby. Or how she must have felt to have EVERYONE calling her Baby.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177402.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Royalty. Legit worked with this hood dude named royalty. I think it kinda speaks for itself.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177403.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. You know the Duggar family (19 Kids and Counting)? One of their daughters named their son Spurgeon. SPURGEON.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177404.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. I knew three sisters names -Autumn-Breeze, Summer-Skye and April-Rain.

Bonus addition one of them had a kid and named it Gidget.

Edit for those wondering: This is in Eastern Canada.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177405.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. One time when I was working at a motel, I took a reservation over the phone from a woman for her daughter:

Woman: Her name is Sri Lanka, S R I space L A N K A...

Me: Oh, you mean like the country!

Woman: Whaddaya mean, country?!?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177406.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. There is a kid at my school literally named Shadow Black.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177407.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Tequila, but pronounced tuh-quill-uh</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177408.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Strap in and prepare for rough seas!

My mom is a midwife and one day she came home with what she thought was the epitome of dumb names.

These parents had just gotten back from a trip to the states, where they had visited a dock to look at boats, and one of those beautiful boats had an even more beautiful and exotic name, they wanted to name their baby daughter after this boat.
