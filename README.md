## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">34 Things Unique to Certain Countries</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. United Kingdom. I dont believe any other countries have the annual chasing cheese down a hill competitions.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166492.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. United Kingdom.Pantomimes at Christmas.Real ale.Separate hot and cold taps.Mint sauce.Brown sauce.Thanking the bus driver (with a Cheers, drive in my neck of the woods).Apologising when someone else steps on your foot.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166493.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Finland. Saunas in most apartments or at least apartment buildings, haven’t lived in a building that doesn’t have one.A lot of great well known (and underground) metal bands.And a nuclear power plant that is at this point 11 years behind schedule and according to Wikipedia the 3rd most expensive building in the world.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166494.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. People count out loud the number of fouettés in the theater at the live performance of Swan Lake.In Cuba, due to reasons too long to explain but definitely having to do with communism, classical ballet is a popular art form in the sense of not bourgeois. So the social composition of the crowd that comes to the theater for the classical ballet is not what you would expect in any other country. Mix that with natural latin irreverence and what happens is that people have ended up cheering the ballet dancers as if it was a sport. In particular, in the classical choreography of Swan Lake, there is a point where the black swan does about 30 fouettés or so and the crowd (that has seen the choreography before) goes like ONE! TWO! .... SIXTEEN! SEVENTEEN! ... THIRTY!!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166495.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Have farms larger than Connecticut (14,357km2)Australia has 4 of them. The largest is larger than Israel, 44 of them are larger than Delaware, and this is still more than three times the size of the largest Ranch in the US, the Waggoner Ranch in Texas.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166496.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. USA. Tipping and gun ownership.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166525.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. A week-long nationwide water fight in Thailand.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166497.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Such cheap olive oil. And eating incredibly late. Lunch is more or less at 1-3 pm, and dinner at 9-10 pm. That is why in Spain we have snacks between foods.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166498.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. In New Zealand it is normal to be barefoot in public. In the mall, the supermarket, fast food places etc. Its even normal for kids to go to primary school barefoot. Its recognised this is unusual and has become a point of national pride for some people.Dont get me wrong, its not like everyone is doing this, but its a noticeable minority and would be seen on a daily basis, even in winter.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166499.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Wales. Place names like this llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166500.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I live in Belgium and I doubt there are many other countries where two people who are both lifelong citizens of the same country cannot speak to each other.This happened to my friend, a Walloon, who met an old Flemish lady. She didnt speak English or French, he didnt speak Dutch. They legit could not speak to each other, but they were both Belgians through and through.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166501.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Milk dispensers at school cafeterias (or restaurants but its not as common). I live in Sweden where food and drinks such as water and milk is provided free for students. Whenever i tell someone outside of Scandinavia that we have milk dispensers theyre always very surprised.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166505.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. National Crate day! In NZ we have Crate day to celebrate the first day summer which is basically celebrated with a crate of local beer, a bbq and sports, usually at a mates flat or the beach.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166506.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. South Africa. Calling traffic lights robots. Caught myself doing this with foreign friends and being treated like an idiot.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166507.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. In Colombia, hot chocolate is served with slices of salted cheese in it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166510.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Iceland here. We have a music festival held inside a glacier and deep inside a volcano. We also charge $1,000,000 for a ticket tooBonus fact: This was the same festival where last year Bam Margera was knocked out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166511.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. In Mexico we experience paranormal stuff very close. Even people like me, who doesnt believe in it, have parents, siblings, children or grandparents who have experienced ghosts or other entities very close.Not in the friend of my friend kind of way. It is really really common to be in the same room, and someone just says: I saw my great-grandfather coming out from the well or stuff like that. And nobody makes a fuss about it. We just process it and move on. But really, I dont know anybody who hasnt experienced a close encounter with something paranormal in one way or another.And again, Im an atheist and a skeptic. I havent experienced something at first hand. And that makes me an exception. Not the average.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166513.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Canada. Bagged milk, legal weed and fermented maple syrup.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166514.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. India. Cheap Streaming subscriptions. In my country a pack for Disney+, HBO, Showtime, ABC, Live Sports and a lot more, costs less than 2 dollars a month. Yes 2 dollars TOTAL.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166515.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Germany. Driving 300km/h and still getting passed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166516.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Canada. Poutine. Goddamn are you guys missing out on poutine. Seriously unhealthy, but also good for the soul, so is it really unhealthy? Yes. Yes it is.

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Italy. Bidet, apparently. Also, the fact that every supermarket here has a section with fresh cold cuts, cheeses and bread-like products. Couldnt find a single one in CaliforniaLunch break is an actual break, where you sit at a table and have a 2/3 course meal. People wont likely just eat a sandwich and get back to work.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166519.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">31. South Africa. Biltong, spiced dried meat.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166521.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">32. USA. Screens in your windows.I didn’t know that wasn’t a thing all over the world until I commented on a post here on reddit.There was a post showing a person with a personal bug net around their bed to keep the bugs out. I was like “wait why don’t you guys have window screens to prevent bugs getting in your house in the first place”Apparently a ton of people don’t? I never knew that, thought it was interestingMosquitos, black flies, and horse and moose flys here in Maine are super bad during the summer, I can’t imagine somewhere like the tropics.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166522.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">33. Root beer. In America this is widely available and basically universally liked, but give it to someone from another country, especially a European country, and they will hate it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166523.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

One day this mom in her shiny convertible car and 200 dollar jeans parks her car where it is completely blocking the road and goes to pick up her kid. When the bus drives up, it can’t get by. Bus driver honks for a couple minutes, but the mom is no where in sight. When she finally comes out, she’s not even bothered by the fact that she’s been blocking traffic for 10 minutes. She just takes her sweet time getting in her car with her kid and finally drives off.Still makes me mad to this day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87166612.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
