<span style="font-size:4em">1. Army Ants will create balls during high water floods. The ball will roll allowing every ant to get a breath. - H010CR0N </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210292.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. There is a genus of frog called Mini. There are only three frogs in the genus, and their scientific names are all puns: Mini mum, Mini ature and Mini scule. - SwimmingOnMars</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210293.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. The chemical compound which is used to make fake banana flavour is the same compound honey bees use as an alarm pheromone.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Rabbits dont have pads on their paws. Only fur. So if you see a cartoon rabbit with pads on its paw, completely wrong. - FOTBWN</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210296.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Vultures urinate on their legs and feet to cool off on hot days, a process called urohydrosis.

<span style="font-size:4em">8. The vast majority of Greenland sharks are blind thanks to a special parasite that eats their eyes and replaces them. It is thought that this might actually be helpful because a) their eyesight was shit anyway, b) the parasites wave like lures and may have an anglerfish-like effect, and c) the sharks are super slow so that might be one of the few ways for them to catch live prey. Imagine something eating your eyeballs and it being an upgrade. - Fabled_Webs</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210299.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12.

<span style="font-size:4em">14. A kangaroo will mate again one to three days after giving birth. The newborn will latch onto a teat in the pouch and as long as it thrives, the kangaroo can put its newly fertilized embryo in a state of dormancy and have a back up baby ready to go.

<span style="font-size:4em">
If the newborn grows out of the pouch or dies, the kangaroos hormones will send signals to start the development of the egg. So they can have an adolescent Joey, a nursing one, and one in stasis all at the same time. - themoonhasgone</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210307.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Axolotls are real life Frankensteins monsters.

<span style="font-size:4em">
After some time, the arm is completely attached and useful while attached to the back like some disgusting Mr Potato Head. Some people did a test where they completely severed the head of an Axolotl and just pasted it next to the head of another one to see if a head could do the same thing. It worked. The brain started thinking again, ate food after their esophagus attached, and became a fully functioning 2 headed axolotl. - WillyMcHilly489</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210312.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky4" id="linky3">People Reveal Secrets from Different Jobs They’ve Worked</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I work in organ donation. The general public doesn’t understand literally any of it. One notable thing is that when you register to be an organ donor, it’s a legally binding declaration about your wishes after death. It is akin to a will under gift law. - anonkraken</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210201.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Laser printers basically shoot lasers at a rolled up Polaroid, magnetize tiny bits of chopped up crayons onto a belt in that pattern, blow it all onto a sheet of paper with electricity at an opposite voltage, and then melt it at a temperature hot enough to bake a chicken for a fraction of a second before handing the results to you. 
</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210202.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210203.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
This is a generalization, of course, but the fact that printers work at all is pretty much witchcraft. - Jazeraine-S</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210204.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Working for giant companies, it’s comical how many systems are raggedy messes of bare-bones functionality. All available money gets thrown at certain projects, leaving everything else to work on complete shoe-strings. - DontWorryImADr</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210205.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Anesthetics - we only ask about your illicit drug use so we don’t kill you when we give you a general anesthetic and that you have appropriate pain relief. You’ll have a tolerance that we need to counter by giving you a variety of drugs and more of them. No judgement from us on your choices - just want to actually take care of your properly. - killingkirby</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210206.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I work in IT support. Legit about 80% of all problems are solved by rebooting the computer/terminal/phone. If not, 20 percent is pure detective work. - Sarato88</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210209.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Crisis hotline. Sometimes we get really disturbing prank calls. I always encourage people to call back if they are ever in crisis. A lot of times, they (the prank callers) do. - fieldsofjade</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210207.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. That as a trucker, that space I left in front of me is so I don’t kill anybody, NOT your personal invitation to jump in front of my bumper because you forgot your exit or whatever reason. So many want to get in front of us and slow down and park in front my bumper. YSK: Don’t believe the billboards those ambulance chasing lawyers put up about big truck accidents mean big bucks. Only survivors get money, most likely not you. If you do survive, more than likely your quality of life is going to be miserable.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Also YSK: these trucks can weigh up to 80,000 pounds, 34,000 pounds empty and around 20,000 pounds without the trailer. How does that compare to your SUV or even your lifted pickup. Do us all a favor and give us some space, leave us room so that you can live and go home to your family. One final thought, NEVER assume the other driver sees you. - gfinchster</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210212.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Ex-security guard here. Were not there to protect you. Were there to observe and report. Dont assume that just because whatever building youre working in has security that youre safe.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I work at a large biotech/pharmaceutical manufacturing company. The drugs you take or buy from your local pharmacy are so insanely and meticulously regulated & inspected at every step of the journey - from petri dish to pharmacy shelf, that you could take a pill from a bottle and it can be traced back to the exact room it was made in, the exact equipment that was used, who was responsible for each step, and the time it was made down to the very second. Seriously, there are no missteps when it comes to GxP. - StaircaseRailing</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210216.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. When you call 911, please say your address before anything else. It doesn’t matter if someone is actively dying, say your address first. (I’m from a rural area so this might just be a problem where I’m from) but if you’re calling on a cell phone sometimes it can ping in a completely different spot then you are. If you call and don’t say where you are and we get disconnected, I might not have any clue where to send rescue/police/fire and therefore I cannot help you.

Say your address (if you don’t know then please give like a cross street or notable location) first, then preferably your name, THEN tell me what’s going on. A lot of people assume that we automatically have a precise location where they’re at, and the systems can be pretty accurate but you can’t always rely on them. If you say the address and we get disconnected I can at least send someone to the area to figure out what needs to be done. - imscaledandicy</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210221.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. The vast majority of content on most business websites is not intended to be read by a human, its purely there to look interesting to Google so you can be pointed to the only thing that matters on the website: the Contact Us form. Which means that some truly sad people spend their lives writing hundreds of pages of garbage they dont even want to be read.

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I work with recycling, I can assure you that recycling is WAY more dangerous than it looks like. People throw away loose razor blades, glass (sometimes even whole knives) theres also the problem with human excrement.

## <a href="#linky8" id="linky7">25 Unsettling Facts About Our Universe</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. The farthest galaxy we can detect was 13.4 billion light years away when it emitted the light we see today. That light (not the galaxy, the light itself) is three times as old as the Earth.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210227.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210248.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. There is a theory (Proton decay) that states that protons, one of the fundamental building blocks of matter, can just spontaneously evaporate. The amount of time this takes is astronomical, but current theories predict that all matter in the universe will decay away until there is nothing left but particles of light and empty space. The time it will take for this to happen is incomprehensible, but it is the most likely scenario for how our universe will end.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210245.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. The fact that the Voyager 2 Space probe after over 40 years has not even hit a pebble.....</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210231.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If you gathered together all the matter in the universe we can observe right now ,and squished it together until it had the density of water, (1gm/cm^3) it would fit into a cube about 1 light year on each side. There are several disturbing things about this. A single light year is almost unimaginably huge. A cubic light year is a ridiculous volume of space. The observable universe is 33 orders of magnitude larger than that. It is almost entirely empty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210232.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The largest black hole we have discovered has a diameter of 490.000.000.000 km. Earths diameter is roughly 13.000 km.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210233.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. There is no up or down.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210234.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Time-lapses of the Future send me into an existential crisis every time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210235.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Here’s one closer to home. The Kessler Effect is the theory that a single destructive event in low Earth orbit could create a cascade where satellites break up into tiny fragments taking out other satellites, breaking up into smaller fragments and so on, until the earth is completely surrounded by a massive cloud of tiny flying death shrapnel, which would make leaving this planet almost impossible. If you look up how much space debris there is already up there and how many satellites currently orbit, plus the continued growth of the commercial space industry... I think about it a lot.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210236.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210237.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. That we, as a planet, are literally flying through Space. I dont just mean around the Sun, because our Solar System is flying through space as well. Along with our Galaxy too. Where Earth was one minute ago is a point in space that we will never return too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210230.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Rogue planets. Such objects have been ejected from the planetary system in which they were formed or have never been gravitationally bound to any star or brown dwarf. If a rogue planet invaded our Solar System, things could go very wrong.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210238.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. In about 150 billion years, intergalactic transportation and communication beyond our local supercluster will be impossible. In about two trillion years, galaxies outside of our local supercluster are no longer detectable due to redshift. Assuming the universe keeps expanding, then the universe’s final fate depends on whether or not protons decay.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210239.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. More of a theory than a fact, but I find the Dark Forest theory pretty disturbing. Basically the idea that there are other civilizations out there but they are staying quiet for good reason.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210240.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I truly don’t believe most of us are capable of comprehending the vastness of space and the distance between things.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210241.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. There are voids in the universe that are so big that if you were teleported to the center with a spacesuit on, you would just see pitch darkness in all directions.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210228.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. In 2019, scientists at the Royal Institution of Australia (along with NASA and other international space agencies) completely missed a football-field-sized asteroid that came eerily close to Earths atmosphere and had apparently realized it only minutes before it passed Earth.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210242.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. The near impossibility of interstellar human travel.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210243.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. We still dont know exactly how it came into existence.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210244.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. At 600KM above planet Earth the temperature fluctuates between +258 and -148 degrees Fahrenheit. There is nothing to carry sound. No air pressure. No oxygen. Life in space is impossible.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210246.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. I just learned about something called Angular Diameter Turnaround. Basically, things that are far away look smaller; but things that are really far away look bigger, because when their light was emitted, the universe was small and they were close to us.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210247.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. How easy it would be to become completely and totally isolated out there. In space, technology is the only thing keeping us alive. The only reason we dont freeze suffocate or starve. Imagine the day when humans advance to traveling deeper into space. Imagine not having communication. Completely alone in the blackness of space. Or even worse, your engines die and youre just forced to sit, hoping and praying that somewhere in the vast universe someone comes across you. Thats scarier than any movie monster.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210229.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. The images you see are galaxies not as they are but as they were, based on how many light-years away they are. This is fine for anything within the thousands but if we are talking millions or billions of light-years away then there is a good chance that none of those stars you see even technically exist right now. On the bright side though, if we can figure out how to move faster than light then we could see our own planet with a good enough telescope as it was in the past. We could observe any outside historical event or even dinosaurs.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210249.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. We could literally get vaporized at any moment from a space death laser traveling at the speed of light, so we cant even detect it before were dead.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210250.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Time is not linear due to the constant expansion of space therefore time is expansive.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210251.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky10" id="linky9">Some Lesser Known Badasses From History  </a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Simo Hayha. Finnish farmer. Got drafted. Killed 505 Russians in the Winter War, making him the deadliest sniper ever. Didnt use a scope. He also killed 200 more with his machine gun</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212630.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Im gonna go with Chinese pirate queen Ching Shih. Started as a prostitute, ended as the leader of a fleet of 300 ships and 20000 to 40000 pirates.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212631.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Mary E. Walker - doctor, and first and only woman to have the Congressional Medal of Honor from actions in the US Civil War.She was the daughter of active abolitionists and the only woman to graduate with a medical degree when she attended Syracuse Hospital (and one of the first). When she was refused from medical military service, she started treating the wounded who were dragging themselves home. She eventually was allowed in the military in 1863 as an assistant surgeon.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212629.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">  The infantry she served with (Ohio 52nd) had lower casualty rates. Attended battle-ground wounded and crossed enemy lines to attend women and children and civilians injured. She was captured by the Confederates in 1864. She treated her fellow POWs while held, refusing to dress or act like a lady.She then worked in Tennessee at a woman’s and orphan asylum through outbreaks of tuberculosis, fever. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212634.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> The hospital records of her service do not name her work, in favor of her male supervisors, but a medical award now is given in her name. Also campaigned, with risk of imprisonment, for womens right to vote. Respect for her service kept her from arrest.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212635.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Ben L. Salomon. He was a front line surgeon in WW2. During the battle of Saipan he was in a surgical tent helping wounded soldiers, when he noticed a Japanese soldier bayoneting one of the injured men. He shot the Japanese soldier and then quickly dispatched several other Japanese soldiers who came into the tent. He then took control of a mounted machine gun and went to town. When they found his body, he was shot and stabbed 24 times and had killed 98 Japanese soldiers. He repositioned the machine gun 4 times due to him not being able to shoot over the mountains of bodies. He was given the Medal of Honor in 2002.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212636.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Hugh Glass: While on a fur trapping expedition, Hugh was attacked and mauled by a grizzly bear. He was able to kill the giant bear with some help, then passed out. His group left him thinking he would never survive the wounds or the journey which was 200 miles away from the nearest town. Glass regained consciousness only to find himself abandoned, without weapons or equipment. He was suffering from a broken leg, the cuts on his back were exposing bare ribs, and all his wounds were festering. So he cleaned his wounds with maggots, made a boat, fought off wolves and 6 weeks later made it back to civilization, crawling a large portion of the way.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212637.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Miyamoto Musashi. He was undefeated in the 60 duels he fought, and he won one of them with a wooden sword.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212627.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Diogenes - a homeless Greek philosopher who lived in a barrel and m*sturbated in public. He also had an epic encounter with Alexander the Great. Wile Diogenes was relaxing in the sunlight in the morning, Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favor he might do for him. Diogenes replied, Yes, stand out of my sunlight. Alexander then declared, If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes, to which Diogenes replied, If I were not Diogenes, I should also wish to be Diogenes. In another account of the conversation, Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212639.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. There is no way Stanislav Petrov isnt the most badass person ever. On September 26, 1983, Lt. Colonel Stanislav Petrov was in command at Serpukhov-15, a bunker where the Soviets monitored their satellite-based detection systems. Shortly after midnight, panic broke out when an alarm sounded signaling that the United States had fired five Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs, toward Russia. The warning was a false alarm—one of the satellites had misinterpreted the glint of sunlight off clouds near Montana as a missile launch—but to the Soviets, it appeared the United States had started a nuclear war. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212632.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">Protocol demanded that Serpukhov-15 report any signs of a missile launch to the Soviet high command, but Petrov had a hunch the warning was an error. He knew the new satellite system was mistake-prone, and he also reasoned that any nuclear strike by the Americans would come in the form of hundreds of missiles, not just five. With only minutes to make a decision, Petrov chose to ignore the blaring warning alarms and reported the launch as a false alarm—a move that may have averted a nuclear holocaust. The incident remained classified until after the Cold War ended, but Petrov later received several humanitarian awards for his extraordinary actions, and was even honored by the United Nations.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212641.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Michael Malloy. Malloy was a homeless alcoholic man. Five men took out life insurance policies on him and tried to get him to drink himself to death by giving him unlimited credit at a bar that one of them owned (so that they could collect the money from the insurance company). This wasnt working fast enough, so they started putting anti-freeze in his drink... then turpentine, then horse tranquilizer, and finally rat poison. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212642.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">None of them killed Malloy. The men then tried feeding him raw oysters with wood alcohol and poisoned, spoiled sardine sandwiches (filled with carpet nails). Again, none of this worked, so they waited for him to pass out drunk one night, then dragged his body out into the -26 °C night and left him there to sleep (pouring 20 liter of water on him for good measure). The next day, Malloy came into the bar and ordered another drink. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212643.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">The group then ran him over with a car at 70km/h. This hospitalized him for a few weeks, but again, didnt kill him. Eventually they succeeded by putting a gas pipe down his throat (after he passed out drunk of course) and pumping gas into him for an hour. The group were later convicted of murder (due, in no small part, to the fame of Malloys durability), with four of them receiving the death penalty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212644.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
