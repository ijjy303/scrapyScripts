## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">32 WTF Ways People Almost Died</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I snorkeled too far out into the ocean, and it wasnt because it was a riptide, I just got distracted by pretty fish</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142864.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Went to go visit a friend in Gloucester Mass in winter back in high school far from my home. I was planning on staying overnight at their house but their mother who I now know has mental health problems wouldn’t even let me in the house because the father wasn’t home working a night shift. Friend said sorry bro and closed the door. Almost froze to death waiting outside in 10 degree F at night. A cab driver saw me slumped on a bench and woke me up. Let me get warm and drive around in the passenger seat while he picked up drunk people out on the town all night. When he finished his shift he dropped me off at the train station and handed me 7 bucks for the fare. Dude probably saved my life and I can’t even remember his name.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142859.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I walked into a back room freezer of a grocery store. The huge door was designed to close automatically. I knew this and went in and did what I was there to do. After 30 seconds, I couldn’t catch my breath. I thought maybe I was just working to hard so I stopped and took several huge breaths, nothing. I felt like I was drowning out of water. I had to move as quickly as I could back outside of the freezer and feel to my knees gasping when I got out. It was only afterwards I realized for some dumb reason someone kept open dry ice in a cart inside of the freezer.

Dry ice removes oxygen out of the air in enclosed spaces. I almost died from lack of oxygen and would have been an icicle when they found me.

Don’t f**k with dry ice.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142860.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Being sleepy on the road. Dont. Find a spot and sleep a bit.

Seriously, it happened to me twice. You think you wont fall asleep, but you will.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142861.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Went to Grand Canyon and tried to be funny and acted like I was gonna slip,[it was snowing], and ended up almost really slipping and falling. Some random guy scolded me like a little kid because he got more scared than me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142862.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Stuck my head out the car window bc I wanted to see why dogs loved it. My grandpa didnt notice, rolled up the window, and I choked. He freaked out when he heard the cat like noises (ironic) I was making while my neck was trying to squeeze through the small opening of the window, but kept raising the window in his panic. Eventually he got it and I was left with a red mark on my neck and no closer to understanding dogs.

My grandpa passed earlier this year so its a nice way to remember him and I know he get a chuckle to know people found it funny.

it was meant to be funny so dont feel bad for laughing. My lil sis was in the seat next to me when this happened and she was laughing too, funny then, funny now.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142863.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I was in 2nd or 3rd grade, I was getting off the school bus and was walking around to the other side to my driveway. Suddenly the bus driver hits the horn, scared the hell out of me and I stopped at the edge of the front of a bus and a dump truck good speeding around. I dunno if the dump truck driver didnt see the lights of the bus or whatever but that driver made a dumb mistake that could have cost me my life. Thinking about it my older sister was up at our driveway waiting for me, probably would have messed her up for life.

After that the school district changed bus routes to avoid students having to cross the road to get on or off the bus</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142865.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Waited too long to go to the hospital (pre-Covid) I thought I just had a cold. Husband said, go to the doctor. I said no. Three days later, still not great. Husband said, go to urgent care. I said I will if I dont feel better tomorrow. Next day, I tell husband, I need to go to the ER. A collapsed lung due to pneumonia.Three days in hospital plus breathing issues for the next year. Moral: Listen to your spouse. And yeah, got a whole lot of I told you sos. Deserved every one of them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142866.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. While drunk, I sat down outside...to rest for a moment...on a freezing cold Winters night. Fortunately, a passerby noticed me and encouraged me to get inside. I figure I was probably there dozing for several minutes.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142867.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I commented on a controversial post on reddit</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142868.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Taking apart a dryer completely to clean it out and get it running smoothly again, dropped a screwdriver onto an exposed wire… huge arc and zap sound. I had left it plugged in (up until I realized the incredibly smooth-brained move I had pulled)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142869.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Smoked cigarettes for 23 years. Had a heart attack at 39. Pretty f**kin stupid if you ask me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142870.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. I almost drowned in the sea as a kid. A current pushed me away from the shore. Lifeguards saved me and were slapping my face. I thought it was a punishment but they were resuscitating me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142871.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Started hiccuping with peanut butter in my mouth. Peanut butter went down the wrong tube, I started choking, but couldn’t cough bc these hiccups wouldn’t f**king stop. Finally leaned over and managed to cough it out, but it was a close call</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142872.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Im Italian but have been living in the UK for two years

Guess who looked at the wrong side of the road while a Bus was coming trough?

Everytime I went back to Italy I risked my life for the same reason by getting used to drive to the left and viceversa</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142873.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Swam under a shipyard pier at night (solid concrete above me) and lost my sense of direction. Got lucky and found my way out.

To add more detail - A friend and I were assault swimmers attacking a ship for a training exercise at night. We would swim from pier pylon to pylon underwater. Take a breath, go under, push off, and swim ~20 to the next pylon, surface and repeat. My mask broke and I was doing it with my eyes closed due to having contacts at the time. One time I just kept swimming and felt like I missed the pylon. When I went to slowly broach the surface I found myself under the concrete above. I had no idea the pier was even built like that. Put my hands up and oriented myself. It looked dark in all directions but my gut told me to the right is where I came from. After that, I stayed on the surface! Cheers!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142874.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Came very close (about two inches) to backing into a warehouse rack full of two ton coils of sheet metal when I didnt realise that my forklift was in reverse.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142875.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. I stuck my head in a random beaker to sniff something in chem lab, I have been very good about wafting since</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142876.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Yelling at someone in the hood, they tried to run me over with their car and then got out and chased me</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142877.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Grown adult and choked on mozzarella cheese. Was only alone for 20 minutes. Cant imagine the obituary</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142879.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Drove on an interstate during a hurricane and watched all the cars around me get submerged</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142880.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22.

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Unplugging the washing machine with wet hands. My hand slipped onto the prongs while they were still partially in the outlet, and I think my heart stopped for a second before I yanked the plug free. Definitely do not recommend.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142882.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Fell through the ice. The great lakes freeze partially in the winter. Far out there was an ice ridge, and on the other side was this clear glassy ice as far out as I could see. I climbed over the ridge to take a leak in privacy, but it wasnt solid. Went through. Wife had to put down our first infant son to fish me out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142883.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Choked on a small potato at the Pizza Hut salad bar. Completely lodged in my throat. I raced to the loo and shoved my fingers down my throat, and it popped out. Walked back to my table and finished my salad. I was with my boyfriend. He did nothing. I grabbed the waitress’s arm. All she did was say “is she okay?” to my boyfriend. Hence running to the loo to deal with it myself!!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142884.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. I was very small (probably around 5) and when my mum wasn’t looking I tied some clothes around my neck and hooked it to the stair railings, then tried to jump off the railings to see if they would hold me. Fortunately I was too small to climb over the railings and my mum found me before I would’ve jumped.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142887.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">30 Trashy Things People Have Seen At Weddings</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I was actually the bartender but it was a hoot. 1st, wedding was outside and it stormed violently. Groom was hammered pre wedding. Hit on all the bartenders. Then the DJ got hammered, made lewd comments to women in the microphone. Then basically everyone was hammered, knocked over the wedding cake which also happened to be a table with many candles, so the place caught on fire. Good times. Often wonder how that marriage worked out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143683.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. The best man screwed the grooms mother between the meal and the dancing. The groom finds out and punches the best man, breaking his hand. The best man drives away and gets stopped by the police for drunk driving.

Being a wedding photographer is awesome.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143682.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Camo print wedding dress that was borderline see-through. Walked down the aisle to the Scooby Doo theme. No, nobody knows why they chose that song, including the couple themselves. They divorced a few months later after they both stopped cleaning the house in an act of defiance against one another.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143684.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. My own. In a Mississippi judges office with a bag of Cheetos on her desk. She wiped her hands on a napkin, grabbed a Bible, and did her thing with orange crumbs on her lips. Her work heels were not on because she was in her office. It was extremely rush. I understand that she was on her break but we didnt mind waiting. Idk why they rushed us thru.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143685.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. A wedding where they had a flag that said “I had my wedding on Friday because Saturdays are for the boys”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143686.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The mother in law took a swing at the bride on the dance floor. Still blows my mind thinking about it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143687.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. A wedding on the beach behind Hooters. The officiant stood next to a trash bin. As if it was planned, the trash collector pulled up during the vows. Did he wait to change the bag? Absolutely not. Children at the wedding swarmed the couple like the flies around the trash can just after the kiss, stepping all over her dress. She bent over to adjust her sandal and a pack of Marlboro reds fell out of the bust along with her right breast.

It felt like we were rubber necking instead witnessing a marriage.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143688.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I don’t even know where to begin.. ceremony was comprised of immediate family then followed by a reception with all guests in a relatively nice hotel banquet hall. An hour in at 7pm the open bar was completely closed down because MULTIPLE guests were throwing up in the bathroom sinks causing flooding, the groom was so wasted even before the ceremony but was blackout by the time of reception. During the first dance he kept his hands in his cargo pant khakis the entire time and ate dinner sitting on the floor in a corner of the hall while the bride sat at the head table alone. About two hours in, the groom randomly left and slept at their house while the bride stayed in the newlywed suite by herself.. they are now separated as you may have assumed by this point.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143689.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Grooms best man went around with a naked photo of the groom. Showed everyone including the bride and grooms family. The worst part was there were kids at the wedding including the brides very young son and it wasnt a small photo either like on his phone it was a huge canvas of the groom nude.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143690.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I used to work at a place that had a very large tent-like building that was often used for weddings, receptions, celebration of life events, etc. It was on a local lake in a beautiful area. It was very expensive to rent out ($3,000-$5,000 depending on how much work from staff is required). Well one family rented it out for the trashiest wedding I had encountered there.

The wedding was peacock themed and the decorations consisted of black and teal paper plates, random peacock feathers, and teal paper cups. They wanted to put all this stuff out the night before the wedding. The owner warned them that this is basically a tent on the lake and things left out will get dirty and spider webbed overnight. They ignored this advice and then pitched a fit when they returned the next morning.

Next, the bride had neglected to try her dress on since she purchased it and had gained weight. She couldnt zip it. She ended up buying a white tank top to wear under it and left it unzipped.

Then after the ceremony, everyone was very inebriated and the brides mother set up a chair on the middle of the dance floor had the groom sit there and cheered her daughter on as the bride gave the groom a very very vigorous lap dance.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143691.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Wedding was in a suburban driveway. The maid of honour stole the bouquet from someone’s garden and the best man proudly announced he had shoplifted the rings. The groom wore a button-down shirt that said ‘f**k off’ in fancy lettering. The bride stopped in the middle of the vows to tell her mother to ‘get that [friggin] kid out of here.’ It was her second kid by the previous bloke.

When it was over, we apologized to the celebrant. He said he’d seen worse.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143692.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. A friend of the family is a wedding photographer. We went to dinner with her family a few weeks ago and she explained the most bizarre wedding she had ever been to (which happened to be that same day, and involved someone we all know)

Wedding was behind a trailer in a trailer park

Folding chairs clearly labeled Property of [school], there were two church pews, and several 5 gallon buckets turned upside down

Some of the wedding party arrived on riding mowers

The bride was wearing some screen-printed t-shirt, jeans, and a veil made from cheesecloth

The groom was wearing a jean vest with no shirt underneath and torn jeans

The bride had met the groom just over 3 months prior, as the groom was still married to his 1st wife at the time. Divorce takes 90 days here. Do the math.

Most of the guests were dressed like they were in the middle of doing yard work

Reception was in the same area. Several cases of PBR and Miller Lite, supermarket pre-boxed cheese and cracker spreads, and a few Bojangles fried chicken boxes</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143693.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. A family member of mines 2ND wedding reception was held INSIDE a indoor gun range. The groom was obviously an avid hunter because the entire wedding party was wearing camouflage suits and the bonus was the open bar consisting on two kegs of coors light sitting trash cans filled with ice.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143694.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Both of my middle sisters weddings.

Dont get me wrong, shes the sane one of my sisters and I actually really love her, but she has a, shall we say, unique sense of style.

Wedding #1 was while she was working as a carnie, and was held after closing time on the midway at some podunk county fair. I may well have been the only sober person there, and there were definitely more tattoos than teeth in attendance. She wound up leaving him when he turned out to be an abusive self-centered twat who contributed nothing to taking care of their kid.

Wedding #2 (just last year) was mostly okay, and BIL is a really stand-up guy. But yall, the whole wedding theme was camo. My sister wore a camouflage wedding dress and matching crocs. BIL wore jeans and a dress shirt with a camo vest. The frigging cake was covered in camo-patterned ribbons and IDK where the hell she got camo patterned silk roses but the cake had a pile of those too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143695.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Ceremony was in a park - not booked or decorated, just showed up and found a spot.

Reception was at a scout hall. No decorations again, and for catering the brides family went through Red Rooster drive thru and got a bunch of whole chickens and chips. Like, 5 different cars went through one after the other and ordered, they didnt even pre order.

Groom and all his friends were high as kites and only reason bride wasnt is because she announced she was knocked up.

Groom and his mates bought their dirt bikes and after eating went out and rode them around the hall. Was so loud and muddy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143696.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. The bride made a speech thanking her in laws for financial assistance for the event. Her mother was not thanked and she was furious. There was a long head table for bridal party and parents. It was made out of small tables pushed together covered by one long tablecloth. The mother pulled a small table out of the arrangement, catching the table cloth, and nearly destroying the head table set up. Now the bride got angry and there was much back and forth with various family members attempting to make peace. The mother refused to push back her table and began to invite others to sit with her, all people who were not meant to be seated at the front. Mother of bride continued to sit there and talk s**t about her daughter, the bride, to anyone who would listen.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143697.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. The bride and her sisters did a strip tease/lap dance on the groom immediately following dinner. In front of his grandmother.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143698.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. My friend group and I talk about this wedding to this day, and probably will for the rest of our lives. The bride and groom decided to do things on a very, very small budget. Thats fine! Frugal weddings and budget weddings can be beautiful and nice! There is a difference between a frugal wedding and a cheap wedding, however, and this was cheap. For instance:

- The wedding was in July. They decided to hold it in a non-air conditioned park shelter.

- The decorations were actual trash. The bride decided me and the other bridesmaids needed tiny top hats, which she made from discarded styrofoam cups. Mine had ants in it.

- She asked me to be the MOH. I was flattered but confused. Shed had three MOHs before me, and they all quit for various reasons, mostly baby daddy drama related.

- She wanted live music but wouldnt pay a pianist. My friend Stephens sister said shed play the wedding march on a keyboard for 50 bucks. Said sister couldnt actually play the piano, but she did the prerecorded wedding march song. Nobody could tell the difference because the woman in charge of baking the cake got [drunk] the day before and was baking the cake in the non-air conditioned park shelters little kitchen while listening to the radio. Very loudly.

- The bride and groom tried to write their own vows, got in a fight over it, and didnt tell the officiant until the day of that there were no vows. Fortunately, he was on it and had backup vows ready to go.

- The bride hadnt tried on her dress, which shed bought from aliexpress, until the day of. It was way too small and we had to rip out the back and safety-pin in some satiny white fabric... which would have been great, if the dress hadnt been off-white. The groom made comments and it turned out that the whole dress thing was based on his mom offering to pay for the dress, then rescinding because she had to bail out his brother. My friend, instead of going to an actual store and buying a dress, picked one off of aliexpress.

This would have been less weird if I hadnt been dress shopping with her like, three times because her mom couldnt/wouldnt pick out a mother of the bride dress.

- The grooms ENTIRE FAMILY including his best man and his two groomsmen left right after the meal (spaghetti, green beans, and McDonalds orange drink) was served. The DJ (my friend Stephen and his Bose speakers) didnt know this and tried to announce the grooms dance with his mom... his mom had left. Apparently his family was furious that it was a dry venue. The only member of the family left was the ring bearer... who it turns out was forgotten. We had to take him home because his family wouldnt come get him.

- The groom slept through the rehearsal and showed up to the wedding drunk.

- We had to put another friend on bouncer duty because two of the brides aunts tried to walk away with the cash envelope. We gave him the envelope because he was the tallest and we figured he could outrun the aunts.

- The brides brother was originally on envelope duty but we caught him taking a 50 out of the envelope, so we had to take it from him.

- We had to politely inform the best man he couldnt smoke in the portajohn.

- We had portajohns instead of actual working bathrooms.

The worst, though, was the photographer. As MOH, I was informed day of that I had to keep the photographer 100 feet away from the ring bearer and flower girls at all times. He was a registered sex offender, but also the brides uncle, and he volunteered to do the pictures for free, so... he ended up using a telephoto lens. Because he couldnt get close enough to the wedding party to take the pictures.

They divorced a couple months later after the house they were staying in burned to the ground. I have no idea to this day why they even got married.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143681.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. It was at a Holiday Inn, the groomsmen all were brightly colored prom vests and jeans. I was a +1 to one of the bridesmaids, I just wore a regular suit, nothing fancy. I was still dressed better than the groom and I got dirty looks for it</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143699.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. I worked at a high-end golf club in Seattle that held extravagant weddings on a regular basis. This wedding in Samoa is perhaps my favourite:

-All of the guys wore lime green vests and snapbacks that matched.

-As mentioned in the contract, the wedding party must order food from the golf clubs restaurant. Instead, they order Dominos, and the pizza delivery man serves them pizza while they sit in a beautiful restaurant.

-Right before the marriage, the bride and broom groom had a fistfight, which caused the ceremony to be postponed until bruises could be concealed with cosmetics.

-A live band was engaged to perform at the event, but they were not fed. The lead vocalist decides to speed down the hill during their first break to fetch a drink.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143700.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. There were no tables and chairs. Like none. They had an open bar but no chairs. Everyone had to put their drink on the ground and hold their plate to eat. It was crazy.

Everyone just assumed that some sort of terrible thing happened where the tables and chair people didnt bring them but afterwards I asked her (the bride) what happened and she just said Oh we would have had to pay extra for that.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143701.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. A friends wedding. She was walking down the aisle and had to pause to put out her cigarette. It was a small wedding and her friends thought it was hilarious. Married less than 2 years. She married him because he was in the military and she thought she was getting cash for life. He chose deployment to a war zone over staying with her.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143702.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. I had one of my friends from highschool get married in a trashy way. His fiancé at the time invited him to lunch at Buffalo wild wings and she had also invited the whole family (they where in on it) and once my friend showed up he found out it was a surprises wedding (just like you would do a surprise birthday party) The even trashier part is they didnt like reserve the restaurant or anything so in his wedding photos (standing in front of the bathrooms by the way) you can see complete strangers coming out of the bathrooms.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143703.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. a coworker of mine got married in her driveway. on the invitation it said that everyone had to wear the color purple and they served KFC and hostess cupcakes for dessert. music was a boom box with the local light rock station playing. the worst part was that she let her dogs crap all over the driveway during the reception so no one ever picked up the poop. we all just kinda weirdly hopped around it in our variety of purple hues.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143704.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Half Mormon half not Mormon wedding. The Mormon half was ultra Mormon, the non-Mormon half was a good amount recovering addicts. The mother got her daughters attention by just standing in front of whatever she was looking at including the groom, the photographer, the DJ, didn’t matter. Mom was also pretty high most of the wedding. 22 people in the bridal party, only 2 girls were the brides bridesmaids from before she met the Mormons. They kept getting frustrated because the Mormon bridesmaids kept pulling the bride away from them whenever they saw them all together alone. No alcohol served so the non-Mormon side went to the liquor store across the street and served their own. Cake smash fail, went straight into the bride’s hair. Mormon side started to talk crap about the drinkers and so the drinkers tried to pick fights with the Mormons. Wedding ended early, lots of tears. Such a hot mess wedding. The couple are both dentists.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143705.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. I went to a wedding in a funeral home once. Drove by it three times before realizing that is was in fact the correct address for the venue. Reception and ceremony were there.. completely dry wedding too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143706.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. I went to a wedding that had a Matrix theme. The groomsmen all wore floor length leather jackets and tiny sunglasses. The MC made a slideshow of images from the movie with the groomsmen’s faces badly photoshopped on. They insisted on calling each other “Neo” and “Amorpheous” while high-fiving each other. It was painful.

There was a lot of tension at the wedding and it turned out that the groom had cheated on the bride a few weeks earlier but she had still decided to marry him. His family was really trashy and took the view that their son had cheated because the bride wasn’t good enough for him. The bride’s family was not trashy but pissed that she took him back and obviously hated the groom and his [lousy] family. The sister was the maid of honour and her speech was very sarcastic “just so glad to welcome you to the family… Greg” but it went over the head’s of the groom’s relatives. Everyone who knew the story was cringing.

The groom’s Dad was loaded. He stood up and told a long and convoluted story about a wife giving teaspoons of sugar to God which made no sense and seemed to have very sexist undertones. They cut quickly to the music and the drunk groom’s father hit the dance floor and started grinding with some woman who wasn’t his wife. His wife sees and has a s**t fit and starts screaming at him. They won’t stop fighting so they cut the music and have the four piece, high school band play classical music badly. It includes a squeaky clarinet.

Like a terrible foreshadowing from above, it starts pissing with rain and people start trying to politely leave. Last thing I see, is the groomsmen running to their cars with their trench coats folded up over their heads to protect their tiny sunglasses, while the band plays the squeaky Matrix theme song. It was amazing.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143707.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. The bride had a little too much to drink. She was on her hands and knees throwing up on the front lawn of the reception hall while people were arriving.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143708.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. I got married at a drive through in Las Vegas. The only photo I still had my seat belt on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143709.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. Im so glad I can share this story again.

In my early 20s a childhood friends sister was getting married. I was friendly with the family and all the siblings so I agreed to go. When I got the invitation it said on the invitation no gifts please just money. This didnt seem like the bride. She would be fine with either. I then get contacted by brides mother who tells me to get them a physical gift because the grooms mother is planning on taking any money they get as compensation for planning the wedding.

I get to the venue which is a church but the wedding is not actually in the main part of the church. It is in the church basement. So bizarre. It looks like the set up of a high school dance. My friend whos sister is getting married tells me that her sister never got her dress altered so they had to use safety pins. They walk down the aisle to a Metallica song playing on a boom box.

The ceremony was quick thankfully. No alcohol at the wedding. Ok, it is what it is. There was sparkling 99 cent grape juice at each table. I know it was 99 cents because the stickers were left on the bottles. Brides mother comes over to me and said I wouldnt eat the food. It was actually food that was supposed to be for meals on wheels and some of it was frozen leftovers of food that wasnt used. This was the grooms mothers idea since she was paying for the wedding.

I gave the bride and groom my gift. They said thank you and seemed perfectly happy with getting a physical gift. Grooms mother comes over to me and asks me why I didnt get them cash or a check for a gift. That it said that right on the invitation. I played dumb and said I must have missed that. She was pissed.

Lastly there was a guy there who took a liking to me. He was dressed in a white tank top, backwards hat and sweatpants. You know, some proper wedding attire... He told me he just got out of jail for drugs and that the bloods and the crips wanted him in their gangs. I told him thats interesting because hes white and I thought they didnt usually recruit white guys. He said they just really wanted him and that he hung out with black people all the time. He then told me that you could cure AIDS by injecting dish soap. It cleans out the blood. He asked for my phone number. I declined. Shockingly the marriage only lasted a few years. Groom has full custody of their two kids because bride is not capable of taking care of their children. She had social services called on her multiple times.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87143710.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky12" id="linky11">31 Real Stories Almost Too Strange To Believe</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. During my sophomore year of high school, my sister and her friend tried to set me up on a blind date with the guy who mowed her parents lawn. It never worked out, and we never met. Two years later, during senior year, I met and started dating the guy who Id eventually marry. A couple years later, we discovered that we were supposed to have been each other’s blind date sophomore year. Well have been together 17 years this March!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142935.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. My father had a heart attack many years ago, and I showed up to the hospital at 3 a.m. Given the time and the fact that he was in ICU, I initially wasn’t allowed in. However, I was finally let in by a nurse who calmed me down and allowed me to see my father. He was so kind to our family throughout my dads hospital stay. About six months later, my paternal grandmother was in the ICU for a medical issue, and again, we were cared for by this nurse. About a year later, I received a call from my dad telling me to turn on CNN. Turns out, the nurse was Charles Cullen, who famously confessed to murdering up to 40 patients.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142936.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. My boyfriend and I moved into the same apartment my grandparents had lived in after World War II. We didn’t know until my mum was going through their old stuff to make a Remembrance Day piece for her front hall and found an old letter addressed to them at my address.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142937.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I accidentally set my best friend up on a blind date with her ex-husband. I was going out on a first date with a guy, and he asked if I had a friend for his friend, so I invited my best friend along...and then the guys showed up, their jaws dropped, and we had many margaritas.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142938.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. My brain associates people with colors when I first meet them. The only color I ever pay attention to is yellow. Yellow people are usually really s**y people that I dont like. Its alarmingly accurate.Edit: RIP my inbox. I tried to answer some questions today but cant get to all of them. To answer the repeating ones: I only get colors in person unless Im watching videos or seeing pictures of myself. Im purple. Generally I gravitate towards people in the cooler color spectrum. My wife is coral and is only one of two corals Ive met. My mom is most unique in that I pick up earth tones with her and shes the only person Ive met that I get multiple colors from. Yes to a certain extent there could be some self-fulfilling prophecy going on with my assumptions, though the color pairing is very real and annoying. I realize my comment was accidentally racist, but we all know what Im meaning lol. Thanks for all the interest, glad Im not as weird as I thought!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142939.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. When I was around 8, my dog followed my dad to wait with me for my school bus. While they were waiting, my dad saw Fluffy get hit by a truck, so he took him and buried him. We then went out of town for the weekend. But on Sunday evening when we got home, Fluffy was standing on our porch! Dad couldn’t believe it and told us, I buried him on Friday! Turns out, Fluffy had just been knocked out cold, so he rose from the dead and waited on us to come home.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142940.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I have full-spectrum synaesthesia, meaning that all of my senses are crossed with one another. As a result, I can quite literally taste the rainbow, I can see why kids love the flavor of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and whenever The Rock flexes, I can smell what hes cooking.No, it doesnt make life more interesting for me. Keep in mind, Ive never known anything different.Yes, it does have some small benefits. The condition often helps me with any writing that I do.No, it isnt a superpower, despite what you might have seen on whatever show that got it wrong.Yes, I get asked these questions whenever I mention having the condition.TL;DR: According to some, my life is a permanent acid trip.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142941.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I was eating lunch at Wendys when Bill Murray sat down at my table, stole a fry, dipped it into my Frosty, and ate it.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. The first time I ever went to the casino, on the first slot machine I ever touched, I bet 80 cents and won a jackpot of $800. It paid rent that month.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142943.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I went to the hospital once with, what felt like, really bad period cramps. They cut me open and pulled out an 8lb human being.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142944.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I went from homeless drug addict to a director position at a tech company in a span of 15 years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142945.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. A couple of years ago, I was flat broke and in a store spending my last couple of bucks on ramen to get me through pay day. The lottery happened to be high, so I decided to spend my literal last $2 on a ticket. Well, this little old lady walked up behind me, and since the store was packed, I let her go ahead of me in the line. She purchased one quick pick lottery ticket. I then purchased my lottery ticket and ramen and went home. A couple of days later, I saw her on the news: She was the only winner of a $90 million jackpot. If I hadnt let her in front of me, I wouldve purchased that ticket, and Id be millionaire right now.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142946.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I can’t get brain freeze. Not sure how unbelievable that is, but most people are pretty confused by it. I have some extra bone growth, called a torus, that presses up against my soft palate and prevents me from getting brain freeze.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142948.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. I have seen my own intestine.Since somebody asked: Semi-Truck blew a red light as I was pulling out of the hospital I worked at. The ED crew ran out, shoveled me off the asphalt, and ran me inside. If it had been anywhere else Id have bled out before an ambulance arrived. It broke my left everything, including ten ribs, many if which wound up in my lung, one of which is still unaccounted for. I was fortunate enough not to suffer any spinal damage, but I did lose my left leg below the knee. Ive made a mostly full recovery, less the.leg and significant lung functionality.If you think about how a grape splits open when you squeeze it too hard youll have the right idea.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142949.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. I am completely unable to create new images in my head and everything I picture I have to relate to something I know. Usually when reading a book I picture characters as famous people that they remind me of and sometimes they do not fit remotely. The weirdest example is when reading A Song of Ice and Fire I can only picture Wyman Manderly as Hedonismbot from Futurama.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142950.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

All in the same year.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87142954.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. I once achieved over 300,000 point score (not lines) on Tetris, on the original Gameboy.

<span style="font-size:4em">29. I was eating at Burger King with my Dad in early 1986 when I saw Herb. I missed out on winning $5,000 for two reasons:I was 15, so they would have given the prize to my Dad anyway.My Dad was a malignant narcissist, and he would have kept the money.Also one bonus reason:I was too chicken to say, Hey, are you Herb?
