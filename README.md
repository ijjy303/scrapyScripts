## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">20 Awful Celebs That Are Well Liked Since Their Deaths</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Ray Charles. Made children all over the place and refused to acknowledge them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170032.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Jerry Lewis. He treated his family like shit, cut his kids out of his will and was a real pos on set. Watch some clips on youtube of him and his behaviour. Terrible. Most likely stemming from when he and Dean Martin split from being Martin & Lewis, everyone thought Dean would disappear and Jerry would go on to be a massive star. As it turned out, it was the complete reverse. He was a bitter, bitter person.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170033.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Bing Crosby. Father of the Century. Physically and mentally abusive to all his kids, alcoholic, adulterer, slimy businessman. Check it out....</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170034.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Frank Lloyd Wright. He is seen as a visionary in architecture but he was a horrible person IRL. Raging narcissist, abandoned his wife and kids to run off with the wife of one of his clients, nailed down his selected furniture in a clients home because he didnt like what the client wanted, etc.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170035.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. No one will say it because Americans have a hard time grappling with the military not being heroes, but Chris Kyle was a racist and a liar.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170031.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Coco Chanel revered fashion icon and also Nazi sympathizer.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170037.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I havent seen Michael Landons name come up yet... he did amazing on Little House on the Prairie, but apparently he was actually a raging alcoholic and even his own kids made a documentary about The Father I Knew.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170038.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I feel like Cosby is as good as dead and wouldve been beatified if he had died before he got caught. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170039.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Jimmy Savile. Absolute monster. His celebrity as an English radio and tv personality gained him unrestricted access to hospitals with disabled children whom he abused. That’s putting his life very lightly. Beware if you go on to read more about him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170040.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Johnny Carson. He cheated on his wives and was an all around prick when he wasnt on camera. The most widely know example was him telling Joan Rivers that shed never become the star of The Tonight Show (she was the permanent guest host at the time), then refusing to ever speak to her again after she got a job elsewhere.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170043.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Its probably come up time and again, but John Lennon was not a nice man. His son grew to despise him enough to tell Paul McCartney that he wished Paul was his father.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170036.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Alfred Hitchcock was really really terrible. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170044.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Big PunHes kids and widow hated him, he pistol whipped his wife in front of his children and broke her face.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170046.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. By some Stones fans, Brian Jones. He deserves to be honored for his role innthe band, and for his musical contributions, and its a shame how his life ended, but he also had a history of domestic violence.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170047.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Picasso has been commonly characterized as a womanizer and a misogynist, being quoted as having said to one of his mistresses, Françoise Gilot, Women are machines for suffering. He later told her, For me there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats. In her memoir, Picasso, My Grandfather, Marina Picasso writes of his treatment of women, He submitted them to his animal sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them, and crushed them onto his canvas. After he had spent many nights extracting their essence, once they were bled dry, he would dispose of them.Of the several important women in his life, two, Marie-Thèrése Walter, a mistress, and Jacqueline Roque, his second wife, committed suicide. Others, notably his first wife Olga Khokhlova, and his mistress Dora Maar, succumbed to nervous breakdowns. His son, Paulo, developed a fatal alcoholism due to depression. His grandson, Pablito, also committed suicide when he was barred by Jacqueline Roque from attending the artists funeral. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170048.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Since no one mentioned them yet. Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. In her letters De Beauvoir mentions several romantic and sexual relationship with female students of hers, in one case she met a 17 year old student who she had a relationship, and later introduced her to Sartre who also began to have sex with her. There were a few others who basically made up Sartre’s personal harem, while de Beauvoir acted as the pimp; seducing teenage girls into threesomes with Sartre.Additionally both were signatories of a petition to remove the age of consent laws in France; the petition was written by a known pedo,Gabriel Matzneff, and signed by other French intellectuals including Foucault; who himself has been accused of sodomizing boys. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170050.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Lou Reed, I love the Velvet Underground but many of the band members were awful.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170051.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Frank Sinatra. My grandpas girlfriend and her husband used to work for him, and he was a right bastard. Didnt think that he had to pay people that worked for him, treated employees bad, all the usual human stuff. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170052.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I’ve worked for Prince and it’s a not so hidden secret he was absolutely awful to work with. There used to be a saying “you’re nobody in this industry until you’ve been fired by prince” He’s a legend for sure but was awful to those who put the show on, and his ego was out of control. And when it came down to it, he died from an OD, so for someone who was so quick to fire anyone over a simple mistake and he so critical of weakness, it turns out he had some hidden weaknesses of his own. Also, from all accounts Jim Morrison was an awful awful person.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170054.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Salvador Dali was a fascist that beat women. Patton and MacArthur were pretty shit people too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87170055.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. MLM managers. Not the low level idiots that get suckered into it, they suck too for trying to bring new people into that sh*t-show, but the people who create them know exactly what they are doing. And they are pretty much the only ones who profit off of it. Should be illegal. Pyramid schemes are illegal. -Wereno</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/16/053915/87168600/mlm.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I know there are poachers that come from rural villages who are trying to just put food on the table, which have my sympathy.

## <a href="#linky11" id="linky10">25 Comedic Actors Who Became Fantastic Dramatic Actors</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. John Goodman His performance in 10 Cloverfield Lane was nothing short of perfection. The look of pure evil in his eyes when he killed that guy was horror at its finest.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170240.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Cranston did a spectacular job in Breaking Bad. I was never a big fan of Malcolm in the Middle (it was just ok), but going back through old Seinfelds on Netflix and Cranston as the dentist is hilarious.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170241.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Gene Wilder to me is special. He’s what my model of a complex sensitive man was growing up. Somehow not conventionally good-looking but sexy in that 70s way. Tender, sometimes furious, frantic, sophisticated, intelligent— and sings and dances. I loved him so much. And with Pryor, forget it. Even their mediocre films had such beautiful chemistry.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170242.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Bob OdenkirkHe seems kinda surprised about it, watching his interviews. But damn he does both well in the same role.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170243.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Kurt Russell was a Disney comedy actor for about 10 years until he did a TV movie about a mass shooter then hooked up with John Carpenter.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170244.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Hugh Laurie. Went from A bit of Fry and Laurie to Blackadder and then out of nowhere, House MD and then again with Night Manager.That man knows acting!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170246.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Tom Hanks, if you remember him from his early career in the early 1980s, he was a talented comedy actor... but no way would I have imagined him doing dramas, let alone starring in them, let alone a string of hits.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170250.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Steve Martin transcends acting. He is a great comedian, comedy actor, and dramatic actor, yes.

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Jackie Gleason, from his own entertainment show, to the Honeymooners, to the Sherriff in Cannonball Express, has done some fantastic roles, Minnesota Fats, but one you might have seen is the 1986 film Nothing in Common with Tom Hanks.Gleason is so good, you can sense Hanks soaking up all the acting chops.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170260.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Jonah Hill. So he and the director of 21 Jump Street basically had to bully Channing Tatum into reading for that movie, because Channing had never done a comedy before and didnt think he could pull it off. Turns out he was so funny that Jonah Hill was almost offended, because the short fat guy is supposed to be the funny one, not the big tall handsome guy. Jonah thought it was just a little unfair that a guy who looked like Channing could also be a natural comedic talent.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87170264.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky15" id="linky14">24 Pieces of Advice That Sound Crazy but Aren’t</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Do you understand, that if you try to endlessly stack bricks, no matter how perfect you do it, they will fall over? My boss told me this after I burned out. Just says that no matter how well you plan your work, too much is too much. -u/IsabellaCps</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168611.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Make them tell you no. Its great when youre not sure if you should apply for a job, go for a promotion or a raise, or do something youre afraid of. Dont be so worried about getting told no or failing, youll surprise yourself. -u/Marnett05</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168612.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “If you sit quietly while everyone else f*cks up, you’re going to win big!” -John Oliver. I’ve gotten multiple jobs and school opportunities by just doing my work and not being a loud moron. -u/Redqueenhypo</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168613.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. From my 7-year-old daughter…I still laugh about it today. If you’re ever in an awkward situation with someone or need to just go away, you could always pretend to choke on something. I don’t know where this came from but it’s funny AND it works. You just run away to get a glass of water. -u/Typical-me-</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168614.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If you need to remember something, write it 3x or say it out loud 3x. Always weird when you repeat something verbally 3x, especially names. -u/RainingRetro</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168615.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. If looking for something in a low light environment, try to use your peripheral vision. I read about it in an old WWII manual about aerial combat at night. It has something to do with how eyes work. It has helped me many times over the years. For finding stuff in a darkened room, or outside in a field at night, not aerial combat. -u/BMLortz</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168616.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. No one thinks about you as much as you do. Meaning we’re all worried about people thinking about the tiniest embarrassing things we do, when no one really cares. It gave me freedom to take on more challenges and not worry about failure. -u/derpitaway</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168629.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Dont give excuses unless they ask for it. I.E. if you are late for work, just say that you are late. Not why you are late. -u/Gurkeprinsen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168617.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Time will pass either way—if you want to work to get better at something, accomplish a long-term goal, or change careers or credentials, don’t look at the 2-5 years and think you’ll be too old. If you’re 24 and want to go to college, you’ll be 28 in four years with or without a degree regardless of what you do in that time. -u/Mild-Intrigue</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168618.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Anger and remorse are shadow companions, with remorse always a step behind. I took control over my temper issues by reminding myself of this one-liner. Hope this works for you, too! -u/Cogito747</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168619.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. It’s only embarrassing if you’re embarrassed. The older I get, the more I understand this one. -u/PB-JAM</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168620.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Fail quickly, as in: If your plan may not succeed, better to find out next week than next year. Helped me quit a suffocating job and dig into my own business 10/10. -u/NNakedLunchDate</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168621.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. If you cant fight the fear, do it scared. Got me through a lot of anxiety. -u/ChasingAlnilam</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168622.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. My mother always said Go back to basics whenever I was struggling mentally. I disregarded it for years but now I live by it. I only utilize this way of living during desperate survival times, but its amazing advice. -u/Staceystallion1</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168623.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Don’t beat yourself up forever. Beat yourself up once then move on. Mr. Homer Simpson. -u/Amy-Paradise</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168624.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. If you want to buy something, wait 24 hours and if you still want to buy it afterwards then buy it. This has really cut my impulse buying down and has made saving money extremely easy. -u/ThaMuffMango</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168625.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. People don’t always remember what you say but how you make them feel. -u/THGilmore</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168626.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. When writing an e-mail, leave the recipient field until last. -u/Ocsttiac</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168627.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Stressed, upset, panic attack, ennui? Put an ice cube in your hand. Move it around your hand until it slowly melts. It takes about 5 minutes. Primary Effect: the cold on your skin grabs your brains attention. You stop thinking about what was stressing you out and feel present in the moment. Secondary Effect: the cold cools your blood, which goes into your heart and slows down the beating.

As your heartbeat slows to maintain your body heat, your lungs breathe more slowly as well. It forces you to breathe, which calms you down. After 5 minutes of this, you will feel much calmer, if slightly drippy. -u/LeskoLesko</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168631.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. I tell my daughter to add the word yet after anything about lacking something. I dont know how to play this game. Becomes I dont know how to play this game yet. That sort of thing.

Its meant to redirect negative self admonishment into a drive to grow and learn. And apparently, its sinking in because she will say something like Ugh, I cant make it up this hill! while were out bike riding and then catch me looking at her, give a big eye roll and go ...yet! in the exact tone you think a teenage girl would use. Then she ends up sometimes just rage-succeeding to prove the point, its great. Shes going to be at least 3 times better than me, low as that bar may be. -u/Zambeeni</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87168634.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. If it’s a quick glance, it’s fine. That’s normal and feels mostly involuntary on behalf of the person looking. I notice but it doesn’t bother me. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121137/87169274/etiquette-02.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> If they stare at my boobs while other people are talking—or worse, while I’m talking—that makes me uncomfortable. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/011159/87169320/etiquette-06.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. When women wear graphic t shirts with writing on their chest I’m always hesitant to read it because I don’t want to look like a jackass. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/013504/87169371/etiquette-12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I can tell when someone is reading my shirt versus just staring at my boobs. I don’t mind people stopping and taking a good look at the text, I know it’s hard to read, I’ll even turn and fully face them so they can read it properly. I don’t mind this at all, if I’m going to slap a message on my tits I’m doing it cause I want people to read the message. No biggie! </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/121114/87169272/etiquette-03.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> In fact asking a woman “what does your shirt say” is a really good way to break the ice. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/17/015227/87169386/etiquette-17.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> I’ve seen multiple people mention feeling uncomfortable reading name tags. It’s always okay to read name tags! They’re literally there to be read. I’ve seen some women put their name tags on their upper sleeve if they felt uncomfortable with drawing attention to their left tit so in that instance you’ll know a woman doesn’t want you staring at her chest.
