## <a href="#linky15" id="linky14">30 Things Professionals Wish Their Customers Knew</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Nuclear engineer here, and if you think radiation is the devil incarnate then buckle in for a quick second as I tell you that:1) No one from Fukushima died from radiation exposure. You saw pictures of the horrific devastation from the earthquake and tsunami. Flooding a nuclear plant doesnt topple buildings.2) Nuclear is one of the safest, renewable, and cleanest energy sources that exist. Second cleanest only to water (and air if you count that).3) Unless we start growing energy and picking it off the vine, oil and coal will run out in the very foreseeable future and nuclear is the way to go.4) You get more radiation from eating a banana than anyone ever did from 3 Mile Island. The most radiation I get everyday is from my morning fruit and I play with radioactive sources and crystals all day.5) Nuclear is actually really cool and by making it to the bottom of the list youre pretty cool too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168271.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

Why not trust us once you get here?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168293.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. As someone in the movie/tv business, most people dont realize that doctoring and altering footage is really really really easy for someone with the right software. I see my old relatives falling for obviously fake footage all the time because they trust all video to be real.This problem is only going to get worse as the software gets better.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168272.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. A significant portion of active duty military personnel (in the U.S., at least) spend a majority of their time sitting at a desk doing basic administration work.Im technically trained in my job speciality, but since Im not exactly in a combat zone when not deployed, I spend most days at a computer answering e-mails and s**t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168285.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Doctors/healthcare workers use dark humour as a form of resilience not to be callous or flippant.A lot of traumatic events occur in a hospital on a daily basis.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. As your childs teacher, I see them for 53 minutes a day for 180 days of the year. I cannot undo all of the poor habits youve taught/enabled/encourage and make your kid successful. I see people post on the book of faces about their childs [lousy] teacher because they wont do x or y when those things are the responsibility of the parent. Also, my contract says I work until 3. I will not call, text, or meet with you after hours because I need to have my own life separate from my work life which is really hard for parents to understand for some reason.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168279.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Different artists excel at doing different styles. I work primarily in watercolor, my website and my portfolio are almost entirely watercolor pieces, and yet I regularly field requests from clients asking if I can do oil painting, mural painting, or God Forbid, tattoo them. Just yesterday I had someone ask if Id give them a tattoo, which I have never done before, have not trained in...I try to refer people to other artists I know who work in the styles and mediums theyre looking for.But you make lots of cool things!YES.

I know youre scared because s**t is getting real and youre being charged with a crime, and I know you see everything going on as one big interconnected tangle that has to be straightened out once and for all, but all that happens at arraignment of any consequence is the probable cause determination and conditions of release. Im not ignoring you, I know I only have about ten minutes I can spend with you before we go in front of the judge, but ten minutes is about twice what Id need if we stayed on topic. All the rest of that stuff Id be happy to take the time to carefully comb through with you in my office between now and your first pretrial.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87168292.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
