## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">12 Useful Details Many People Never Noticed</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Most toothbrushes have colored bristles not just for design purposes but also as a helpful indicator that your brush is already too worn out to use. Once the vibrance fades and the fibers thin out, it’s time to switch it out for a new one.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211439.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. One weird car feature you may have seen is the small circular plastic button found on seatbelts. This may just appear to be part of the design, but it actually prevents the buckle from slipping and gives more length to the strap to keep the driver and passengers secured.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211435.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Aside from the aesthetic it provides, brass, copper, and other alloy doorknobs are perfect examples of antimicrobial surfaces. These types of handles eliminate a wide range of harmful microbes within almost 2 hours compared to their stainless steel and glass counterparts.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211436.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. The metal mesh we see on our microwave doors has another purpose, far from being a decorative element. Tiny holes help us take a peek at our food while it’s being heated, keeping us unharmed from radiation as we watch our meal.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211437.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The bumps we see on the bottoms of our favorite soda bottles are not solely made for marketing purposes. In fact, they are designed to bounce back pressure inside carbonated drinks. They also provide stability and are made much thicker compared to their upper part.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211438.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. It is widely known that the hook at the end of a measuring tape is used to grab onto the edges of the object we’re trying to assess. However, its hole enables us to do more than just the fringes. It’s there to accommodate the head of a nail or a screw so that you can do handiwork yourself.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211440.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Another safety feature of cars is the seemingly unnoticeable toggle underneath the rearview mirror. Its purpose may seem vague at first, but once pushed, it can help block bright beams while you’re driving at night by adjusting the angle.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211441.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. These brushes are not for cleaning your shoes — they are much more important than that. They act as shields between you and the edges of the escalator, minimizing accidents, such as stuck clothes or wedged accessories.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211442.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. The famous takeout containers are actually carefully designed with patented packaging featuring many uses. Aside from being environmentally friendly, it can be used as a bowl, a makeshift plate, and a microwaveable box to be stored in the fridge and heated.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211443.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Do you ever wonder why our coffee or juice cups have that distinct concave look on their lids? They are meant to hold your drink, and the slides prevent it from spilling on surfaces. In short, it’s a to-go coaster.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211445.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Aside from carrying our groceries and little ones with us, the metal rails on our supermarket carts are designed to take care of much more. The hoops near the handle are for hanging shopping bags with fragile goods, such as eggs and bread, inside.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211446.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Are you about to fill your tank, but have no clue which lane in the gas station to pull into? Search for the fuel indicator symbol on your dashboard. There, look for the arrow and see where it’s pointing. The direction to where it points is where your gas cap is located.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87211444.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky8" id="linky7">25 Unsettling Facts About Our Universe</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. The farthest galaxy we can detect was 13.4 billion light years away when it emitted the light we see today. That light (not the galaxy, the light itself) is three times as old as the Earth.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210227.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210248.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. There is a theory (Proton decay) that states that protons, one of the fundamental building blocks of matter, can just spontaneously evaporate. The amount of time this takes is astronomical, but current theories predict that all matter in the universe will decay away until there is nothing left but particles of light and empty space. The time it will take for this to happen is incomprehensible, but it is the most likely scenario for how our universe will end.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210245.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. The fact that the Voyager 2 Space probe after over 40 years has not even hit a pebble.....</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210231.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. If you gathered together all the matter in the universe we can observe right now ,and squished it together until it had the density of water, (1gm/cm^3) it would fit into a cube about 1 light year on each side. There are several disturbing things about this. A single light year is almost unimaginably huge. A cubic light year is a ridiculous volume of space. The observable universe is 33 orders of magnitude larger than that. It is almost entirely empty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210232.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The largest black hole we have discovered has a diameter of 490.000.000.000 km. Earths diameter is roughly 13.000 km.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210233.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. There is no up or down.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210234.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Time-lapses of the Future send me into an existential crisis every time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210235.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Here’s one closer to home. The Kessler Effect is the theory that a single destructive event in low Earth orbit could create a cascade where satellites break up into tiny fragments taking out other satellites, breaking up into smaller fragments and so on, until the earth is completely surrounded by a massive cloud of tiny flying death shrapnel, which would make leaving this planet almost impossible. If you look up how much space debris there is already up there and how many satellites currently orbit, plus the continued growth of the commercial space industry... I think about it a lot.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210236.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210237.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. That we, as a planet, are literally flying through Space. I dont just mean around the Sun, because our Solar System is flying through space as well. Along with our Galaxy too. Where Earth was one minute ago is a point in space that we will never return too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210230.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Rogue planets. Such objects have been ejected from the planetary system in which they were formed or have never been gravitationally bound to any star or brown dwarf. If a rogue planet invaded our Solar System, things could go very wrong.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210238.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. In about 150 billion years, intergalactic transportation and communication beyond our local supercluster will be impossible. In about two trillion years, galaxies outside of our local supercluster are no longer detectable due to redshift. Assuming the universe keeps expanding, then the universe’s final fate depends on whether or not protons decay.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210239.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. More of a theory than a fact, but I find the Dark Forest theory pretty disturbing. Basically the idea that there are other civilizations out there but they are staying quiet for good reason.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210240.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I truly don’t believe most of us are capable of comprehending the vastness of space and the distance between things.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210241.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. There are voids in the universe that are so big that if you were teleported to the center with a spacesuit on, you would just see pitch darkness in all directions.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210228.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. In 2019, scientists at the Royal Institution of Australia (along with NASA and other international space agencies) completely missed a football-field-sized asteroid that came eerily close to Earths atmosphere and had apparently realized it only minutes before it passed Earth.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210242.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. The near impossibility of interstellar human travel.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210243.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. We still dont know exactly how it came into existence.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210244.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. At 600KM above planet Earth the temperature fluctuates between +258 and -148 degrees Fahrenheit. There is nothing to carry sound. No air pressure. No oxygen. Life in space is impossible.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210246.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. I just learned about something called Angular Diameter Turnaround. Basically, things that are far away look smaller; but things that are really far away look bigger, because when their light was emitted, the universe was small and they were close to us.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210247.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. How easy it would be to become completely and totally isolated out there. In space, technology is the only thing keeping us alive. The only reason we dont freeze suffocate or starve. Imagine the day when humans advance to traveling deeper into space. Imagine not having communication. Completely alone in the blackness of space. Or even worse, your engines die and youre just forced to sit, hoping and praying that somewhere in the vast universe someone comes across you. Thats scarier than any movie monster.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210229.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. The images you see are galaxies not as they are but as they were, based on how many light-years away they are. This is fine for anything within the thousands but if we are talking millions or billions of light-years away then there is a good chance that none of those stars you see even technically exist right now. On the bright side though, if we can figure out how to move faster than light then we could see our own planet with a good enough telescope as it was in the past. We could observe any outside historical event or even dinosaurs.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210249.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. We could literally get vaporized at any moment from a space death laser traveling at the speed of light, so we cant even detect it before were dead.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210250.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Time is not linear due to the constant expansion of space therefore time is expansive.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87210251.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Mary E. Walker - doctor, and first and only woman to have the Congressional Medal of Honor from actions in the US Civil War.She was the daughter of active abolitionists and the only woman to graduate with a medical degree when she attended Syracuse Hospital (and one of the first). When she was refused from medical military service, she started treating the wounded who were dragging themselves home. She eventually was allowed in the military in 1863 as an assistant surgeon.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212629.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Ben L. Salomon. He was a front line surgeon in WW2. During the battle of Saipan he was in a surgical tent helping wounded soldiers, when he noticed a Japanese soldier bayoneting one of the injured men. He shot the Japanese soldier and then quickly dispatched several other Japanese soldiers who came into the tent. He then took control of a mounted machine gun and went to town. When they found his body, he was shot and stabbed 24 times and had killed 98 Japanese soldiers. He repositioned the machine gun 4 times due to him not being able to shoot over the mountains of bodies. He was given the Medal of Honor in 2002.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212636.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Hugh Glass: While on a fur trapping expedition, Hugh was attacked and mauled by a grizzly bear. He was able to kill the giant bear with some help, then passed out. His group left him thinking he would never survive the wounds or the journey which was 200 miles away from the nearest town. Glass regained consciousness only to find himself abandoned, without weapons or equipment. He was suffering from a broken leg, the cuts on his back were exposing bare ribs, and all his wounds were festering. So he cleaned his wounds with maggots, made a boat, fought off wolves and 6 weeks later made it back to civilization, crawling a large portion of the way.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212637.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Diogenes - a homeless Greek philosopher who lived in a barrel and m*sturbated in public. He also had an epic encounter with Alexander the Great. Wile Diogenes was relaxing in the sunlight in the morning, Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favor he might do for him. Diogenes replied, Yes, stand out of my sunlight. Alexander then declared, If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes, to which Diogenes replied, If I were not Diogenes, I should also wish to be Diogenes. In another account of the conversation, Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212639.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. There is no way Stanislav Petrov isnt the most badass person ever. On September 26, 1983, Lt. Colonel Stanislav Petrov was in command at Serpukhov-15, a bunker where the Soviets monitored their satellite-based detection systems. Shortly after midnight, panic broke out when an alarm sounded signaling that the United States had fired five Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs, toward Russia. The warning was a false alarm—one of the satellites had misinterpreted the glint of sunlight off clouds near Montana as a missile launch—but to the Soviets, it appeared the United States had started a nuclear war. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212632.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">Protocol demanded that Serpukhov-15 report any signs of a missile launch to the Soviet high command, but Petrov had a hunch the warning was an error. He knew the new satellite system was mistake-prone, and he also reasoned that any nuclear strike by the Americans would come in the form of hundreds of missiles, not just five. With only minutes to make a decision, Petrov chose to ignore the blaring warning alarms and reported the launch as a false alarm—a move that may have averted a nuclear holocaust. The incident remained classified until after the Cold War ended, but Petrov later received several humanitarian awards for his extraordinary actions, and was even honored by the United Nations.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212641.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Michael Malloy. Malloy was a homeless alcoholic man. Five men took out life insurance policies on him and tried to get him to drink himself to death by giving him unlimited credit at a bar that one of them owned (so that they could collect the money from the insurance company). This wasnt working fast enough, so they started putting anti-freeze in his drink... then turpentine, then horse tranquilizer, and finally rat poison. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212642.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">None of them killed Malloy. The men then tried feeding him raw oysters with wood alcohol and poisoned, spoiled sardine sandwiches (filled with carpet nails). Again, none of this worked, so they waited for him to pass out drunk one night, then dragged his body out into the -26 °C night and left him there to sleep (pouring 20 liter of water on him for good measure). The next day, Malloy came into the bar and ordered another drink. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212643.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">The group then ran him over with a car at 70km/h. This hospitalized him for a few weeks, but again, didnt kill him. Eventually they succeeded by putting a gas pipe down his throat (after he passed out drunk of course) and pumping gas into him for an hour. The group were later convicted of murder (due, in no small part, to the fame of Malloys durability), with four of them receiving the death penalty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87212644.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. The vast majority of Greenland sharks are blind thanks to a special parasite that eats their eyes and replaces them.

After some time, the arm is completely attached and useful while attached to the back like some disgusting Mr Potato Head. Some people did a test where they completely severed the head of an Axolotl and just pasted it next to the head of another one to see if a head could do the same thing. It worked.
