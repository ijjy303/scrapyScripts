<span style="font-size:4em">1. Never count your cash in public even if in singles.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139464.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Always look like you know where youre going, even when you dont.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139465.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. If someone starts to loudly state that they’ve lost their wallet or phone, don’t obviously or immediately go to check on yours in your bag or pocket. It’s a common pickpocket technique to get people to show the pickpockets where their stuff is.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139466.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. There is no shame in running away from a fight.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139467.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Ladies, never leave your drink unattended and dont accept drinks from strangers when you didnt see the drink being made.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139468.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. If someone approaching you says “hey man, I ain’t gonna rob you” - they’re probably gonna try to rob you.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139469.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. If youre uncomfortable with your surroundings, leave.

Your unconscious is often more aware of your surroundings than youd think. If something you cant figure out is telling you to go, listen to it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139470.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Trust your gut. If anyone seems a little too friendly, get away ASAP.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139471.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. If you are feeling unsafe, find the biggest friendliest person and act like you know them, chances are they will understand, help you out and youll end up making a friend.

Had a group of young men once nod in a targeting manner towards me in a dangerous subway station in SF, the big dude I sat next to, and acted like I knew, was understanding when I explained why I was sitting next to him, we ended up chatting during the subway ride too. Very cool guy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139472.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. If you ever find yourself homeless in a big city but want to keep clean because of job/hygiene standards/whatever, look into gyms in the area. Many of them have very low-cost memberships or even free trials for a certain amount of time. Head on in, get your shower, brush your teeth, and get yourself all cleaned up.

Hope it helps anyone who needs it as much as it helped me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139473.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Know where the exits are at all times.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139474.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Always check the toilet paper roll before taking a dump.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139475.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. If someone is asking you for help, but you need to follow them around the corner to help them... dont. Politely say youre late to a meeting and keep walking.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139476.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Blend in. Everywhere. Even if you’re faking it. And, if you’re faking it, get out as soon as you inconspicuously can.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139477.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. If youre in the hood and you see kids playing outside, youre probably safe. If there are a lot of people outside but no kids, be super cautious and walk with a purpose. If its empty or only teenagers/young adults, get out asap.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139479.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Always put something between yourself and the ground, even if its just a piece of cardboard. Especially on asphalt, it absorbs heat and it will feel like its sucking the life out of you</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139480.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. If you see something potentially illegal going on dont look directly at them.

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Always get the money upfront.

People who want to pay later probably wont and then things can get messy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139482.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. You can get into a lot of places by holding a pizza.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139483.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Your elbow is the strongest joint on your body… take advantage of it when you can.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139484.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Exercise your legs. Although in a bad situation theyll probably feel like wet noodles, if needed youll be able to run. It will also show in everyday life that you are capable of moving effortlessly. Most people are sluggish and its not hard to notice.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139485.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. If an attractive woman asks for directions, look for her partner behind you or going into your car to take what they can grab.

Typical vacation area scam.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139486.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Wear shorts under ur pants keep your valuables in ur shorts</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139487.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Walk on the road if you’re in a real shady neighborhood and it’s late at night. Not in traffic but away from alleyway entrances.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139488.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Look with your eyes, not your head.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139489.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. Listen always and speak only when you need to. People dont know when to shut up.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139490.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Never show your watch, wallet, or phone in areas known for pickpockets.

Also dont touch your pockets if you see warning signs, because a good thief will be watching to see which pocket your valuables are in.

And when approached by someone on the street be mindful of who else is watching and what is behind you. Try and keep everything in front of you and dont be afraid to shout and swear at them to get attention.

If someone puts a gun or knife in your face dont be a hero.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139491.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Another tip: get to know your local homeless people. If you live in a city and regularly walk past the same homeless people, stop and say hi once in a while. Just have a brief chat and give them some change. Even a smile helps. Believe me, these guys know EVERYTHING about what happens on that block. If youre ever in trouble, theyll help you out if youve been friendly, or they may just pretend they didnt see a thing. They can also help watch your car - for instance if someone dings it and drives off, they might even get the plate for you. View the street as their home; when walking on the street, youre walking through their living room. They can be excellent hosts.

This doesnt apply if youre traveling in a new city. Not worth befriending a homeless guy if youre only there for like 2 days.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139492.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. This one isn’t so much protection, but when you’re walking and you know how people do that little shuffle thing when they walk towards each other because you don’t know which way the people are going. Well if you maintain a line of sight in a direction, not looking into the eyes of people coming towards you, people will just move out of your way. No awkward little dance.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139493.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">31. Only break one law at a time.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139494.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">32. If someone asks you for help. Like my car wont start or, really anything. Dont help them but offer to call someone for them.

I learned this ~10 years ago. I had to do a thing in the bad side of town once a week early in the morning. I would get there ~5:00 a.m., they opened at 6:00 but I wanted to get in and out and leave.

There were a few other regulars at that time for the same reason. One I befriended was a lady named Kim.

We were both there one morning. A couple of guys pulled up in their car ~100 from us. They got out, lifted the hood made some noise, called us over to help them. They were having car troubles.

Kim told me to stay where I was, I shrugged and said OK. She walks over, they talk a few minutes, they drive off and she comes back.

Kim says They didnt have car trouble, they were going to rob us.

I say Seriously? No s**t. Why did they drive off then?

Kim says I showed them the gun in my hand. Then she showed me the gun in her hand.

I said Oh. OK</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139495.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
