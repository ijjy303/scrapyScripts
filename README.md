## <a href="#linky7" id="linky6">15 Trends People Will Regret in the Next Ten Years</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. “Posting way too much Information or pictures of your toddlers and children on social media. It will stay on the internet forever and some of the posts will be very embarrassing later on. It isnt like the kid really understands or consents to have their pics posted to social media.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/06/21/101608/87196451/trendsreplace.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “posting about almost every aspect of your life on social media. I posted some pretty cringe stuff as a kid that is still floating around somewhere, and that was before social media became big. I cant imagine what its going to be like now.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195051.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “Ape nfts.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195059.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “Ignoring criminal acts by politicians.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195058.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “I think people are just starting to regret naming their kids Danerys and Sansa.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195053.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “Facebook has explicitly encouraged its users to break down privacy barriers between different aspects of their life, e.g. work, school, and family. This is not a theoretical effect but an intentional one; Zuck has explicitly said that in his view, people who maintain boundaries between different parts of their life lack integrity and that its Facebooks goal to promote integrity in this specific sense. This is deeply dysfunctional.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195054.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “Quirky misspelling of names.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195055.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “The destruction of public education (squeezing and outright sabotage of public schools, prohibitive costs for secondary education). The normalization of being undereducated, either through apathy or because of forces outside your control. The idea that opinion is equal to fact and that sticking to your original viewpoint is heroic. Yeah, your studies may say that, but this is how I FEEL about it and similar arguments. The reason we are no longer a minor species of omnivorous hunter-gatherers is our ability to pass along knowledge to others. Each generation building on the achievements of prior generations is the path to progress in health, quality of life, equality, production and so much more.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195060.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “Mommy bloggers who post constant pics and details of their children. Robbing children of privacy for likes and money is sickening.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “Some body modification trends. People in my age group are already regretting some of what they did to themselves in their early 20s. I cant imagine that this generation will fare any better.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195062.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “The Death Stars werent badly designed they were just badly managed.
Yes, designing them assuming large scale assaults was stupid given the political state of the galaxy but the second Death Star wasnt even finished so that doesnt count, its all Palpatines fault. As for the first one that was finished, the Alliance made three runs on the exhaust port. The first was called off before they made it to the trench, the second failed and the third was carried out by space Jesus which isnt exactly fair. All in all it sounds like a fairly effective defence when you consider the design philosophy.” - Engeneus</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195139.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “Not sure if controversial but they need to take the franchise and yeet it 200 years in the future. Im tired of the Empire era where they need to justify why more than 2 jedi and 2 sith exist at one moment along side knowing everything is pointless until Luke leaves the farm.” - Alandrus_sun</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195140.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “It is shown on multiple occasions that droids are very much alive with their own personality (C3PO, R2D2, L3,K-2SO, and more). Its clear robots are as alive in the Star Wars universe as any other alien race, yet they are treated worse than slaves by both the good and bad sides. C3PO and R2D2s memory being erased like its nothing, given away like slaves. Its quite hypocritical from the good side to treat droids like slaves yet be all goody two shoes about helping the flesh bodied creatures of the universe.” - wulfnstein85</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195141.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “I like Star Wars. The movies, the shows, the games. But the community ruins it. They complain and bitch about every single thing there is. It’s fantasy, not history..” - absoluteunit94</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195146.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “Return of the Jedi is my favorite SW film. Whenever someone says the words Star Wars my mind immediately goes to any particular scene in that movie.

<span style="font-size:4em">18. “In retrospect, it makes no sense that Obi-Wan and Yoda didnt train Leia alongside Luke and just left her as a backup. As one character recently said, shes just as important. In fact, Luke shouldnt have been the sole focus of the original trilogy. It shouldve been both of them.” - MegalodonDentistry</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195152.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. “Disney should have not even touched the time period where any of the original stories take place. They should have made entirely new stories set hundreds, thousands, millions, or billions of years before or after the Skywalker Saga. I mean Im glad they made Rogue One and Jedi Fallen Order. But other than that, they should have made entirely separate stories that didnt even mention the Skywalkers or the Solos.” - stonebolt</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87195154.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. D-Day was originally supposed to happen on 5th June but meteorologist James Stagg persuaded Dwight Eisenhower to postpone it by a day right at the last minute.
