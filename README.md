<span style="font-size:4em">1. I love the show Law and Order, but I have to wonder how much damage its done to our public view of police officers. On the show, if someone takes the 5th, theyre guilty. If a cop beats up a suspect, they were guilty. Heck, if they shoot them, interrogate them hard, frame them, lie to them, hack their personal computers, etc... its all okay, because theyre guilty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125408/87179995/propoganda1.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. America’s Got Talent. It promotes the idea that talent goes hand in hand with struggle, so much so that genuinely awful acts make it through on the strength of their sob story.People have a hard enough time accepting the work that goes into being a creative without having to attach a tragic backstory to it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/05/31/125438/87179998/propoganda3.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
