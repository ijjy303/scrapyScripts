<span style="font-size:4em">1. At a Petco, all the Guinea pigs were in a big plexiglass enclosure with a center divider. Boys on one side and girls on the other. An employee decided that all the long haired Guinea pigs should be on one side and short-haired on the other. It took forever to sort them out and all the females were pregnant.

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Not a mistake necessarily, but I once witnessed our chief accounting officer (and our only accountant; it was a small company) type in values into two Excel cells, pull out a calculator, add the two numbers together in the calculator, and then type the answer in a third cell. She had apparently been doing this for years, with sheets consisting of thousands of rows. I explained how to use formulas and copy them but she apparently forgot because I saw her doing the same thing again months later.

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Tried to cool down hot oil (in a chute, all ready to be emptied) with a nice big bucket of water…..I heard “THOMAS NO” only to turn around and see a GEYSER of hot oil shooting towards the ceiling before it hit and splashed down around him. Nobody was hurt some f*cking how.

<span style="font-size:4em">4. When I worked construction, there was a guy who showed up with nothing in his tool belt except a small bag of peanuts in one pocket. He didnt stay around too long.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I had a coworker who was a guidance counselor at five schools in the district. She was supposed to work one day at each school, unless she was called to a school for an urgent case. She would frequently call the school she was supposed to be at, stating she had an urgent case at another school.

<span style="font-size:4em">
One day at lunch she was talking about what was happening in her favorite soap opera. This was before VCRs, and the show aired long before the school day ended. The principal was sitting at our lunch table. He got up, smiled, and told her, see me when you are done with your lunch. After checking, she hadnt seen more than a few kids per week, for many months. Funny thing is, complaints about her work had gone down in that time. She was a crappy guidance counselor.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. The designer, creative director, and head of production all missed that there was an eight-day week on a calendar. We sent 10,000 copies of a useless calendar to a client. Rightly so, they refused to pay for it.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I worked on a golf course during the summer. Area with lots of poison ivy. Two of my coworkers were instructed to weedy a river edge area. If we encounter poison ivy, we either stop what we are doing or go get full suit protection with respirators. These dumbasses were weed-whacking in the thickest poison ivy I had ever seen. No protective suit or glasses or respirator. I roll up and notice what the hell theyre doing and point out all the poison ivy everywhere- they were aerosolizing the oil. They both ended up in the hospital on steroids to prevent their death because of the oils they inhaled.

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I grabbed the arm of an intern once, right as he was about to grab a 00 gauge (the big wires that feed electricity the whole building) bare-handed to move it out of the way to show us a problem behind. It was hot.
</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87201439.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">
 He claimed it was fine cause he was only gonna touch one wire at a time. The lead electrician respectfully requested said intern be removed from his sight before turning himself into carbon and paperwork. I agreed with this sentiment and had an intern watching OSHA videos for almost 3 days straight as punishment.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. I worked in a paint shop and every time a new chemical was introduced to the shop, I would ask about the hazards. They would tell me that it is a green chemical; there are no hazards. Its baby safe they would say. Once when I entered the shop I saw a guy using a new spray. The side of the bucket indicated that it was dangerously poisonous and highly corrosive.

<span style="font-size:4em">
I told him that he should be using a mask and gloves to use that chemical. He said Dont worry, its baby safe. They even have a picture of a baby playing in it. Sure enough it did.
After seeing the image, I yelled at the guy This is the baby. He is not playing, he is not swimming, HES DYING!

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Shut down a critical file server, then lied about it...even after he was presented with the logs that showed it was his user account that initiated the shut down. Its not so much the mistake that he made, but it was when he lied about making the mistake...that was a rookie move.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. New guy was dragging two 8000lb rolls of paper through the warehouse. This is against the rules for good reason, anyway, he drove through a door designed for 1 roll, and drug the top roll through the wall.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. When I was in the Navy, this known dumbass and pathological liar was on armed watch with an M-14 patrolling the topside decks. Literally, all you have to do is walk around for 4 hours with a rifle on your shoulder. This dude came back to the Quarterdeck (main entrance to the ship) WITH NO GUN. He tried to claim it fell off his shoulder and into the water while tying his shoe. How a rifle would fall off your shoulder, pass through your hands that were tying the shoe, and through all three lifelines (like guard rails) is still a mystery. My theory is that he was doing drill team stuff - like tossing it spinning in the air - and lost it that way.

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Worked in a machine shop. One of the lathe operators left the bar of cold-rolled steel he was turning hanging out the back. When he turned the machine on, it literally deformed and turned into a freaking helicopter blade that ripped the back of the machine apart, and eventually flew off at high speed. Luckily no one got hit by it. If so, theyd be dead.

<span style="font-size:4em">15. The office we worked in was shut down due to Covid and the company went 100% remote. A new senior engineer was hired to work directly with our product team and also manage a team of developers. During our company-wide weekly Zoom meeting after he was done presenting for the company he turned his camera off but forgot to put himself on mute. 100+ people heard this man playing Fortnite and talking down about the company to someone else in the background among other things. He only lasted a month.

<span style="font-size:4em">16. I used to work for a landscaping company and over the course of a summer, I witnessed one of my co-workers accidentally set 3 different things on fire (a hedge trimmer, a truck, and himself).

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Poured sink cleaning solution into the ice cream machine instead of the cream mixture and I had to stop them, they then said: Im sure itll be fine, it was only a little. No that would poison people. I had to clean out the whole machine top to bottom and refill it. I ended up throwing away nearly a whole bucket full of contaminated ice cream mixture. I would also like to add that the containers didnt look anything alike, the sink stuff came in big plastic jugs with screw tops and the ice cream comes in cardboard cartons (like orange juice) that you have to cut open. So I dont know how she could have possibly mixed the two up.

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Took the wrong coffin to a funeral. Someone else had to drive to the cemetery with the correct deceased on board, and thankfully they made it before the viewing.

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I worked as a Radiation Protection Tech at a power plant that was re-fueling. My job was to sit outside of a contaminated area and if anyone wanted to take something out of the area (tools, etc.) I had to make sure it didnt have any radioactive particles on it. To do this you wipe the tool with something like a tissue and then hold the tissue up to a machine called a frisker.
