## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">12 Common Myths People Falsely Believe Are True </a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. There is no gravity in space. Actually, gravity is everywhere. It shapes the orbits of the planets, the solar system, and even the galaxies. It is true that gravity decreases with distance. So the further you are away from a planet or star the less gravity you feel. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135679.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Gravity is pulling us down, so every ship in the orbit around the Earth is slowly falling toward our planet. And since the ship and our astronauts are falling at the same speed and the latter have nothing to press against, they feel so weightless.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135680.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Lightning never strikes the same place twice. That’s a nice proverb, but a little bit far from reality. Of course, repeated lightning strikes have a very low probability, but they are not impossible. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135681.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

Take for instance the Empire State Building which is struck by lightning about 20-25 times each year. The building was once struck 8 times in 24 minutes, so being hit several times within a short time span isn’t that unusual after all.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135682.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. All dinosaurs went extinct after an asteroid hit the Earth. Sometimes it seems like we learned this in school. In reality, though, the asteroid killed about 75 percent of all plants and animal life on the planet, some small species of dinosaurs survived and evolved into birds. This fact is supported by fossils dated after the so-called K-T event. Yet the extinction also provided evolutionary opportunities. Before the event, mammals tended to become dinosaurs’ meals. After that mammals, at last, got a chance to evolve into larger and more complex species, like horses, whales, bats, and primates.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135683.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Doing crunches will give you a flat stomach. Unfortunately, we cannot target fat loss in our bodies. We can only build more muscle. So doing crunches alone won’t give you a flat super-impressive stomach with that ever-elusive 6-pack. If you don’t eat healthily and don’t do cardiovascular or full-body training in addition to that, you’ll just build lots of muscle under your belly fat and it may seem even bigger than before.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135684.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The 5-second rule.  It is still believed that if you drop some food on the ground and pick it up within 5 seconds, it is safe to eat it without rewashing. Some people extend that to 10 seconds, some think it helps them to develop a robust immune system, others simply don’t care much about it. But either way, there are too many germs on the floor and if something lands on them they immediately stick to it, no matter whether it is food or not.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135685.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. There’s a dye in pool water that detects urine. This “scary” myth came right from our childhood. And really there’s no better “remedy” in this case than making kids believe they can be caught peeing by some super-cool ingredient that they add to pool water. While in reality there is no such thing as a urine-detecting dye even though there are many warning signs that the pool is monitored with a chemical “pee alert.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135686.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Touching a toad will give you warts. This myth probably originates from the fact that toads have many wart-like bumps on their skin. In reality, those are just glands and toads don’t secrete anything that can cause warts on our skin. As dermatologists say, actual warts are only caused by human viruses. Though the toads’ glands may contain poison that really irritates the skin.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135687.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Penguins fall backward when they look up at airplanes. Legend says that British pilots were buzzing around the islands off the coast of South America and they saw penguins toppling over like dominoes when the birds looked skyward. Well, scientists tested this story and found out that these amazingly awkward creatures can maintain their footing perfectly, even while looking upward. Though low-flying aircraft can really cause them to panic and leave their nests.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135688.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Opossums hang by their tails. This myth has also appeared in some popular movies. And like many others, this myth is also totally illogical and absurd. Sure opossums can grasp branches with their tails while climbing trees and babies can hang by their tails for a little while. But adult opossums are too heavy to do that for more than just a few seconds. Besides, it is completely useless because would inhibit their survival. All in all, they simply have no reason to do this.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135689.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. If you touch a baby bird with your bare hands, its mother will reject it. It is common among parents to not allow their children to touch any nests or the baby birds inside them. Also, it is believed that even if you pick up a lost baby bird and return it to its nest, its mother will reject it because of the human smell on its dear baby. In reality, most wild animals have a very strong bond with their babies and they won’t abandon them no matter what.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135690.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky4" id="linky3">32 Police Officers Share Their Most WTF Moments</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Not me, but my friend is a cop. He pulled up to an accident scene once involving a motorcycle. Gets out of his car, starts walking over, and sees the guys helmet. Figures he’ll be nice and bring it over to the guy. Well, as it turns out, the guy was still in the helmet.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135802.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. The kid drowned at a local pool so I had to tag along with the ambulances for an investigation. I got there first and saw his father holding him crying and my heart sank. I ran over there and tried to perform CPR to the best of my ability for about 10 minutes before the ambulance arrived... he woke up right as it pulled onto our street. I preceded to visit him in the hospital and now he swears he wants to be a police officer.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135801.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Not me but my grandpa was on the California Highway Patrol for 20 years.
He always told the story of how he pulled over this guy for a busted taillight. My grandpa asks him for his license and registration, and the guy says, “how’d you catch me so fast?”

Grandpa said the hair on the back of his neck never again stood up half so fast. Turned out the guy had robbed a bank not five minutes before.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135803.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I pulled up on a teen sleeping in a vehicle at the end of a country road. When I ran the license plate, I found out that he was reported as a runaway. The doors on the vehicle were locked, so I knocked on the window to wake him up. Once he woke up and realized what was going on, he shot himself in the mouth with a rifle he had hidden under his blanket. Rough way to start my shift.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135804.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Im putting this story in just to lighten the mood. I observed this, Im not a cop. Two cop cars were rounding the corner of an intersection, in opposite directions. They crash but were going slowly enough that no one was hurt. They both got out of their cars, laughing, pulling out their ticket pads, and started writing each other tickets.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135805.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. As a rookie, I was responding to an alarm at the restaurant that was supposed to be “haunted by a woman.” The first officer that arrived was an older officer that didn’t do much and didn’t even get excited on the radio. As soon as he arrived he asked for a second unit in a high-pitched tone. As I pulled in he had his shotgun out and he was leaned up over his hood. My first thought was “ oh s**t someone is breaking in “. When I ran up to him and asked what was up. All he said was as he pulled up and his lights hit the building a woman jumped off the roof and disappeared. He was clearly shaking. I and another officer checked the building and found no evidence that someone had been there. It made an impression on me and I never went back to the restaurant at night without another officer.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135806.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. A law prof in Australia spent 20 years as a cop before becoming a lawyer and eventually teaching. In explaining the battered wife syndrome defense to murder, he told a story of a call to a little old ladys house where she had said on the phone that she had [taken out] her husband. Before this incident, he didnt really understand why it existed. Why doesnt the woman just leave? Why doesnt she just go to someone elses house?

Prof shows up at the door and is greeted by a little old lady saying come in, would you like some tea? He goes in and she starts putting some cakes on a tray and pouring tea. He wonders if shes all there.

He asked, so you said that you [took out] your husband on the phone, would I be able to see him? She directs him to the living room where the old man was on a lazy boy chair, bottle in hand, and a tomahawk in his skull. Meanwhile, the old lady is asking if he takes sugar or milk in his tea.

The prof said at this moment he realized why the defense of battered wife existed. The drunk old guy had been beating her for years, controlled all the money, and didnt let her have friends. She had nowhere to go even if she left him. So on this day, after saying he was going to beat her if his sports team lost, she took matters into her own hands.

He said this was the moment he realized that sometimes there are situations where life doesnt make sense and people take the only way they can see.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135807.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Former paramedic here: I responded to a crash on the highway that required the extrication of the driver. I hop in the back seat and hold c-spine as the fire starts taking off the door, cutting posts, etc.

The driver starts asking where Mollie and Fred are, and if they’re ok. I’m confused because she was the only occupant of the car. I ask her if she’s talking about the other car and she says “No, they’re my pet tarantula and snake.” I look in the floorboard and there are the remains of two terrariums, but no Mollie or Fred.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135808.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. My husband has been a police officer for over 20 years. One night he was patrolling the downtown area when he noticed a purse someone had left behind. He opened the bag to check for id and found a turd. Some lady [pooped] in her handbag and left it behind. Hell talk about autopsies and burnt bodies, but that is the one story he would rather forget.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135809.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. My older brother is a cop. He got a call about a [disturbed] teenager behind a school with a knife. He rolled up to the spot and when the kid noticed him he immediately started hacking at his own neck with the knife. My brother sprints over to him and tases him. Saved the kids life</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135810.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Ex-cop from NSW Australian here. A guy once passed away in a motorcycle accident. We went to deliver the message to his girlfriend. After reading the collision report the truck driver said he just pulled straight in front of him like he deliberately was trying to take his own life. She was not answering so we forced entry. The shelves of the fridge were on the kitchen floor. Opening the fridge we discovered multiple pillowcases with her cut-up body inside. That was certainly an ‘oh s**t’ moment.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135811.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Nothing makes you go oh s**t more than stopping an obvious drunk, feeling like you could be stopping a homicide in progress, to realizing you know the person...maybe you know them really well.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135812.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Got a call for an emotionally disturbed person. Arrive on scene and a 350lb man built like an NFL lineman is passed out of on the floor face down. His wife says he suffers from PTSD from the first Iraq war and that he was an army ranger. He had been drinking heavily. His son is on scene and about 16 years old. The man begins to wake up and proceeds to smash his forehead into the ground, repeatedly. We call for an ambulance. A small pool of blood begins to form on the floor. The wife grabs a rag and goes to wipe it up when this guys head jerks up real quick, his face contorted in rage. He grabs the wife by the neck and throws her clear across the room onto the couch. We immediately jump on him but he is preternaturally strong. There are four of us and we are each fighting one limb. The kid jumps in and helps us get two sets of cuffs on him because one set was not wide enough to connect his wrists behind his back. I ride in the ambulance to the hospital with him while he glares at me angrily reciting his military registration number and telling me I wont get any information out of him and that Im a towel head (I dont remotely look like Im from the region). The entire ride I hope that he doesnt break out of the cuffs. If Im being honest, Im not sure we wouldve gained control of him if the kid hadnt helped.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135813.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Former Paramedic.

Known former gang member, and seriously bad dude who was suffering from epilepsy. It was known that when he was postictal (after the seizure) he would revert to his gangland days and anyone in uniform he wanted to fight. Hey look, ambulance drivers wear uniforms.

Got a call to his known address, me and my partner are the first to arrive on the scene. I already had the Valium and Versed drawn up and was ready to hit him with a knock you out dose. As I got to the door his mother (a very sweet lady) was hollering hes coming to!!!

I jumped on top of him and with all my might hold him down and rode him like I was on the Pro Bull Riding Rodeo Tour. My partner was able to get the meds into him IM which takes longer to work than IV so I had to do that for the next 5-7 min till Fire showed up. I was exhausted and not really wanting to get my a*s beat rode that bull till 5 more guys took over, I rolled off and was just done.

3 hours later I ended up back at the hospital and he was in there. He apologized, always did, and said he never fought with anyone as tough as me. Thank god for being 40# heavier and a pocket full of mind-altering drugs.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135814.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Not me personally (well, yes and no), but my mother is a police officer and she was pregnant (with me). She went to a call, on the last day before she starts her maternity leave, about a man who was locked in his house and threatening to [take his own life]. She entered the premises with other officers, and like an idiot (I love my mom but...) the pregnant lady takes point. She entered the bathroom where the guy was holed up, and he was sitting in a bathtub with a revolver pointed right at the door, so she yells GUN! and pushes the other officer with her back outside. When they finally claimed the guy and got the gun from him they checked it and said it looked like all the primers had been struck but since it was really old ammunition they didnt go off. She went on her maternity leave and had me and said she almost didnt go back because of that. Now shes a police chief.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135815.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Just checked onto my shift. As I turned my patrol car on, my radio was in a mid-broadcast about an accident just outside the city I work in. I voluntarily checked in route to help out the best I could. While heading there, I was informed that it was actually closer to the next city over but that I would still be the first one there. I was then told it was a head-on collision. I arrived on the scene about a minute later. It was in fact a head-on collision. 5 people from one vehicle were not wearing seatbelts. All 5 were fatally injured beyond any measure. There was nothing I could do. A doctor showed up on the scene shortly after me. Nothing he could do. I watched 2 adults and 3 children [pass away] in front of my eyes. The 6-year-old little girl just stared at me unblinking as she passed... I still get emotional.

They were students at our elementary school. I knew them because I routinely go to that school just to see the little kids and give them junior police stickers, take pictures with them and let them play with my gadgets and police car. I went to the memorial service that the school put on for the girls to pay my respects. Their father was there and didnt know who I was or that I was the first one there or what I saw. He was talking to another father, clearly in between denial and anger phases, about how he wished he knew what officer it was on the scene so he could [take his life] for not doing anything and why didnt he do anything and blamed me for their [passing way]. That was really hard to hear. I wish I was a superhero and could have used magic powers to save those poor children. Im sorry little ones. You deserved to live your lives.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135816.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. This happened in August of last year, was about 1-2 in the morning when a 911 hang-up call came in where all that was heard was screaming and swearing.

I was the closest unit, riding alone as my partner had been voluntold for another assignment that set of days, so when I got out into the area, I was initially waiting for backup however as I was walking up to the house, I heard several voices screaming.

Rushing up to the house, the first thing I noticed was blood.... everywhere. The floor, the walls, the door, are all covered to shoulder height. A distraught woman screamed and pointed me towards the living room.

Once I get into the living room, I see a male and female on a couch, both covered in blood. The male had a massive laceration on his right forearm, and the female had taken a belt and snake wrapped it around his arm to try and stop the bleeding. Seeing how the belt was applied, I knew it wasn’t doing anything to stop the blood flow, so I pulled out my tourniquet and as I prepped it said to the guy “This is gonna hurt like hell, but it’ll stop the bleeding”

I applied the tourniquet just above the top of his bicep and knew it was on properly when he told me his hand had started to go numb. It was at that point I noticed a second deep gash on his tricep that went down to the bone.

It took EMS about 15 minutes to get to the house, and the paramedic made it abundantly clear that had I not applied the tourniquet, the male would have bled out long before they were able to get there.

In the end, turns out the guy had come home drunk and forgot his keys... climbed up to a second-story window, and punched his way into the house, with near-deadly results.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135817.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. My mate had an oh s**t moment on his first week of solo traffic patrols.

Pulled a drunk guy over and the trunk literally had 2 people just chilling in it asleep</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135818.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Not me, but my brother.

My brother was hit by a drunk driver on Interstate 30 in Fort Worth in July 2017. Went flying, laid there for a second, and then got up and arrested the guy who hit him.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135819.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. Was at a traffic stop. My Sergeant came and backed me up due to having to possibly tow the vehicle. My Sergeants vehicle was behind mine and we were both in the right lane. My Sergeant was sitting in his car and I exited my car to go talk to him. As I walked closer to his car I heard a vehicle’s engine rev all the way out but I couldn’t see it. For a split second, I knew what was going to happen and thought oh s**t but couldn’t react fast enough. The vehicle I heard smashed into the back of my Sergeant SUV which struck me, throwing me into the road. The driver was completely hammered and didn’t have a license. This happened last Sunday and I have surgery in a couple of weeks for my knee and my Sergeant has a broken back.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135820.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. We happened to be right on top of the scene when a carjacking with a gun call went out. I saw the car fishtailing in the snow half a block away. We started to chase, and the driver bailed immediately in the driveway of an apartment. I chased him up a hill while my partner ran around the building to cut him off. Just as I crested the hill, a shot rang out - he fired blindly behind him, the old to whom it may concern shot. We chased him through a church parking lot where the bingo game was just letting out, so no return fire. Caught him in a backyard behind the church. The department gave us nice plaques. And cake.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135821.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. We were looking for a guy who stole guns from his ex and found him under a pile of clothes in a closet at a different house. Unfortunately, there were like 7 kids sleeping in the same room so I start getting them out of there while my partner cuffed the guy who was pretending to sleep. We decided to drag him out and I go to move the mattress to get it out of the way and we found the stolen guns under where the kids were sleeping.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135823.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Back when I was an MP, I was assigned to write up abandoned vehicles on an area on a post and found a nasty one with busted out windows no plates while checking it out noticed a couple of wires running from the front to the back. Lifted something in the back and [found this]

A lot of phone calls above my head determined that it was an unlabeled training tool that had been left just laying out in the public by some unit on the post. The next day it had “training” spray-painted on the side to keep anyone only from having the same oh-s**t moment.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135824.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Police paramedic- Went to a bad MVA. When I got home from work I noticed my boot was clicking on my kitchen floor. I thought it was a stone stuck in the tread but it was leftover bits of a fragmented skull. There was some brain in there too.

I decided to trash the boots. I mean, they werent totally worn out, but then again Im not scrubbing brain matter out of my boots at 5 am in my kitchen sink.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135825.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. I’m not an officer but my friends dad was. He got a call that someone took their own life at a residence and he didn’t find out until he drove over that it was the guys daughters 5th birthday. He got drunk with the other dads and they decided to play Russian roulette, with 1911.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135827.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. My BIL was a police officer in a beach town with a large military presence. On one of his first days as an officer, he responded to what sounded like a fairly routine car accident but when he arrived he found a car on fire and a person trapped inside. While he’s pulling the guy out he realized that the persons leg was severed, so once he got far enough away from the burning car he had to put a tourniquet on the dudes leg. A higher ranking officer responded after my BIL gave a better description of the scene and that guy ended up getting some kind of award for his “heroic actions”.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135829.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Former MP here. Partner and I were riding around when we saw another unit dip into a Weapons Storage Area. Figured eh let’s see what they’re up to. Rolled up to the gate and the guard says “You guys here for the bomb leak?”

I’m sorry, what? We are now. Hit the gas and went rolling in to find the fire department and all there investigating.

Had to evacuate the entire weapons area, most of the supply area across the street as well as most of the flight line. Something like a 3000-meter cordon. That was a fun day.

Ended up just being sealant for anyone interested in the outcome.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135830.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. Was a police intern, maybe about my second month in. I got to ride around and help with traffic stops and basically just help the officer on duty. Fairly small town, nothing ever really happened there - mostly just drunks and domestic calls. One afternoon I was with a cop new to the force, fresh from working in the prison. Great guy, anyhow, we are running a speed check on the outskirts of town and find a guy on a motorcycle speeding with no helmet (illegal at the time). Hit the lights, pulls over with no incident. We get out, guy doesn’t even turn around, barely answers the questions through his teeth. Back to the cruiser and run his license. Comes back with several out-of-state warrants with a BOLA attached due to an armed assault against a police officer. We both looked at each other and back at the dude on the motorcycle. Officer immediately unlatches the shotgun from the center console and hands it to me - “If you know how to use this thing, use it”, was all he said. (OH S**T) Without notice, other officers from surrounding towns are already lining up behind us, thank god. The dude was thankfully tired of being on the run and was ready to turn himself in. He went in without incident.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135831.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">31. My husband got a call for a psychiatric emergency when working as an Emt. A kid on a 4 wheeler saw a pickup crash into a stone wall in a field and called the police, who called EMS. Apparently, the driver had driven into the wall intentionally and stabbed himself in the abdomen as well, and then [bled out] or [passed away] of head injuries until someone found him. As my so was leaning in to turn off the engine the truck ran out of gas. That was the weirdest one hes told me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135832.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

The fever from the malaria would go so high that it could kill off an otherwise untreatable syphilis infection. Left untreated syphilis could lead to insanity so it was pretty bad thing. In comparison, having malaria, which we had treatments for, was a blessing

<span style="font-size:4em">5. In July 1184, Henry VI, King of Germany (later Holy Roman Emperor), held court at a Hoftag in the Petersberg Citadel in Erfurt. On the morning of 26 July, the combined weight of the assembled nobles caused the wooden second-story floor of the Peterskirche to collapse and most of them fell through into the latrine cesspit below the ground floor, where about 60 of them drowned in liquid excrement.

At the beginning of World War II, in Great Britain, over 750,000 domestic animals were euthanized out of fear that rations would be spread too thin and pet abandonment would lead to masses of strays. The National Air Raid Precautions Animal Committee (NARPAC) sent pamphlets out to homes suggesting that people should send their pets to the countryside or [kindly] have them destroyed.

So they came up with ingenious ways of killing people. There were stories of a potential Khan that boiled a man alive; other stories include pouring molten gold down a mans throat.

Though not necessarily NSFW, Genghis Khan gave cities the option of surrendering, or face the option of killing every man, woman, and child in that city. He would literally genocide everyone in that city because the ruler wanted to fight back. And thats how Genghis Khan killed 10% of the worlds population at that time; 20-40 million people.

<span style="font-size:4em">24. President Lyndon B Johnson was obsessed with his penis and used it to control those around him. He gave it the nickname Jumbo. Hed threaten Senators by saying he was gonna sleep with their wives and if he went to the bathroom in the middle of a conversation, he expected the other person to follow him into the bathroom to continue the conversation and would get upset if they tried to just wait outside. Sometimes he would swing around while standing at a urinal and talking to someone, leaving his genitals exposed. He also drove himself around on his ranch and stopped to pee on the side of the road so the Secret Service Agents had to cover him and there was a gust of wind that blew the pee onto one of the agents legs and Johnson said that it was his prerogative to pee on the agents leg.

Journalists once asked him why continue the war in Vietnam? and he sent all the women out of the room, took his penis out, flopped it on the table and said, this is why!

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Weird mother on my flight,I was returning back to Istanbul, watching my predownloaded stuff on Netflix. There was a mother next to me with a probably 4-5 year old kid. At first everything was fine; she was distracting her kid with her phone, I was watching the season 4 of rick and morty, then her battery ran out.She gave her kid some toy but after a while kid started crying. I had a powerbank with me and before my battery got to %20, I plugged mine in.After a while she asked me for my powerbank, but I needed it for my phone. She saidIm an adult and you MUST respect you adults, hand it to meShe suddenly turned into a b****.I kindly said I needed it for my phone and pointed a power outlet and said you can use this one.I re opened Netflix and watched the season I downloaded before being onboard. She called a personnel and said that my flight mode wasnt on and I was using Cellular.I showed the downloaded logo and my flight mode and this dumb mother gave up.Then the personnel showed the same outlet I showed to the ****** sitting next to me and her face was priceless.Good thing it wasnt a big problem, the flight went mostly peaceful and calm</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87134094.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. So, A few decades ago, I went from 70 to 0 too fast one night and ended up in the hospital with a pen in my teeth signing a form on a clipboard held over my head that they could cut off both of my hands and my right leg because they were all so mangled that there was a less than 50% chance of them being saved.18 hours of surgery and I woke up with everything I went in there with (and a few extra metal parts to boot) but it took years and a couple of dedicated physical therapists (whom I lovingly refer to as Helga and Ursula the Bitch-Goddesses) for me to be able to walk and use my reconstructed hands.Ive had 4 follow up surgeries since then and I can now walk without a limp but its still difficult to walk very far without pain so I have a handicapped placard on my car. I found out real quick that theres an attitude among handicapped placard owners. They all seem to think that theyre more deserving than you of the spot that you just parked in. That plus FedEx drivers use them indiscriminately.My first experience with FedEx was when I went to get my name registered on the sewer and water utilities for the house we just moved to. There was only one handicapped spot and a FedEx delivery truck was parked in it. So I parked sideways and blocked him in then hobbled my way into the building with my cane. (I was still in physical therapy then)About 5 minutes later, I see the FedEx guy come up:FedEx Guy: Who owns the Silver Infinity outside?Me: That would be meFedEx guy: Youre blocking me inMe: You parked in the handicapped spotFedEx guy: I was only going to be there a few minutesMe: Well now youre going to be there until I finish my business here.FedEx guy: You cant do that!Me: We can call the sheriff and see which one of us gets a ticket.But the Entitled Bitch portion of the story happened a few years later. By then, I was able to walk without my cane and I had encountered more than one of these so I knew what was about to happen and I had prepared my response ahead of time.I had just parked and gotten out of my car and was walking into Wally World when I see the Cadillac moving slowly by with the window rolling down and the EB about to lay out her case on why she deserved my spot and I didnt.EB: Whats your problem?Me: Excuse me?EB: You dont look like youre handicapped.Me: Thank you! Ive worked really hard to be able to walk without a limpEB: I dont think youre really handicapped.Me: You could have stopped talking after the first three words of that last sentence and been entirely correct.EB: So whats wrong with you?Me: *sigh* If you must know, I lost my foot in an accident.EB: Really? How did that happen?Me: I broke it off in some nosey bitchs ass!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87134097.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. The story happened this week on an international flight. The layout of the plane was 3+3 seat rows, and sitting in front of me was a family of mom, dad and a 4-5 year old son on the middle. Our flight got delayed a good deal so the kid was probably already bored out of his mind. Right after boarding the boy takes out the seat table and starts bashing it repeatedly like hes tryna to smack the devil out of it. After 10+ hits the dad asks him to stop as the person in front of them was getting visibly frustrated.Dad: Stop now, youll break it and the angry man will come take youMom: I dont care what they say, its a child and if they have a problem with this they should get up and relocate!As soon as Ive heard it I was furious and low key spent the rest of the flight hating on her. There were no vacant seats on the plane, the consistent seating is important due to covid rules, and, most importantly, what traits is she trying to bring up in her son?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87134098.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. I posted a story about my ex sister-in-law and felt like this spoke more to the type of person she is on the inside.She and her cousin got two cats and brought them home, made sure they were fed, and that was the end of it. They never played with the cats and even changed their names after a couple months because they were just so fickle and indifferent about the pets they chose to adopt.One day, they got sick of the cats that were super antisocial because they never received any type of attention but negative because SIL and her cuz were so fed up with the situation. So they took the cats to the pound. They were warned that the animals would be euthanized if they weren’t adopted after 30 days and to come back and get them if they didn’t want that to happen.The date came and went, and these two grown adults (one in her 30’s) “forgot” and let their cats be put down. I learned of this after the fact because they were so ashamed they swore their family to secrecy, but the tea was spilled anyway. Pretty horrifying.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87134099.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. This happens way too often. We usually turn off the automatic doors around a minute or two before we close, but it doesnt get locked until exactly 8 (or whenever we are closing), we have had numerous people push the doors open at 8 and look like a deer in the headlights when we say we are closed.Imagine being so entitled that you force one of the doors open and are surprised when you are kicked out.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87134100.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky10" id="linky9">13 Secrets Companies Don’t Want You To Know</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. When buying contact lenses, the same contacts that you get for three months, one month, two weeks, and one day are the same lenses. But I didnt tell you that.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135035.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. So I worked at Taco Bell for almost three years, and Im here to tell you all the truth. So, ground beef is in fact real ground beef. It just has a lot of water and seasoning in it. But its safe, I promise. The grilled chicken - I promise its real grill chicken. Youre fine. Go ahead and eat it. The shredded chicken - run, run the opposite direction away from the shredded chicken. You can swap out the shredded chicken for grilled chicken on any of the items, FYI, but the shredded chicken is all the bits of the chicken that you dont want to eat. And I promise you, eventually youre going to get a bone.

Also, the steak, so disappointing. Cause I know its like the most appetizing thing. Its 90% gelatin. If it gets left out for any amount of time, it turns into a slab of gelatin. Just trust me and stay away from shredded chicken and steak.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135026.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Any time you pay for shipping and handling, youre never actually paying for shipping and handling. This is actually a company secret for most companies youll order from online. You see, once a year, UPS and FedEx actually have to go to these companies and renegotiate their service terms for the entire year.

You see, FedEx and UPS charge these companies yearly to actually do business with them. So theyll probably charge them like, I believe, the company I worked for, was $100,000 a year. But every day, they would show up to pick up the packages that you had to ship. So heres an example. You decided to go on Barnes & Noble and you order a book off them for $10. The tax on that item is about a $1.79. So in total, youre paying about $12 for that book. You get down to your checkout and youre going out for shipping and handling, which is what you see is another $7 added into the charge. So youre thinking naturally well, thats just to pay to get it to my house. No, unfortunately, that $7 they just charged you is going right into the companys account.

So basically if they do this all year long, they could end up making more than $100,000. So more or less, you guys are paying for their shipping costs and youre helping them profit as well. Have a good day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135037.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I worked for GameStop from 2011 to 2018. I was a holiday hire, assistant store manager. Knew how to do store manager work. Read the entire employee handbook because it would be freaking boring. Did every quiz, everything, all of it. So, because I read the handbook, I know for a fact that if you open a brand new game and you declare when you return it that it was too mature for your child, based on the ESRB rating, they have to return it. It is in the handbook. It states specifically: can return new open games if it was too mature.

So do with that information what you will.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135029.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I was a manager at a McDonalds. I worked there for about three years. For the tea, they have a red jug for the sweet tea and a green jug for the unsweet tea. These jugs are four gallons big and for every four gallons of the red jug with the sweet tea, there is a full four-pound bag of sugar emptied into it.

One pound per gallon of tea. Yeah, I stopped drinking the tea after I realized that because thats nasty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135028.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I have worked at quite a few restaurants in New York city, maybe like four or five, I think. And I promise you this. If youve been to a restaurant in Manhattan, they have rats. They have rats. I did not say mice. Im not talking Ratatouille. Im talking, Master Splinter - big, huge rats.

And youre like, well, I am not seeing them? Because rats are afraid of noise. So when you come in in the morning, thats when theyre there. When you open the restaurant, theyre there. But then once the people started moving around more, you go around clanging pots and pans and the more people show up, the more the rats stay away.

Im telling you, especially if its Manhattan, especially if its accessible from the first floor. Oh, baby! Yes. Yes, that restaurant has rats. I remember going into work on days, you walk in the morning, you just smell that a rat has died somewhere in the walls, somewhere inside of a booth and you cant find it.

So the amount of covering up... air freshener and candles, yeah. New York City Manhattan restaurants are nasty. And theres probably going to be a bunch of us commenting a little thing like, oh yeah. Guaranteed. And anyone that tells you the restaurant does not have that - dont believe them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135027.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I only worked at Claires for like a summer, so I didnt have that much time there, but I do know - dont get your ears pierced at Claires. Dont let your child get their ears pierced at Claires. And definitely do not let your infant get their ears pierced at Claires.

I only had to watch my manager do two piercings before I was allowed to start doing them. And I only ever practiced on a teddy bear before doing it on an actual human being. A literal teddy. We were told to lie to the families. If they were worried about their child having any type of allergic reaction to the metal, we were told to tell them that the safest metal we had was the 24-karat gold option, which was obviously the most expensive, but thats not true. The safest metal at Claires is actually the cheapest for $15. You get surgical-grade titanium. Yes, theres less options and they look less pretty. They dont have as many gemstones, but you can always change it later. And its the only metal Claires has thats surgical grade.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135030.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. For two years, I worked at the largest social media company in the world. Lets call them Smacemook or Vetta. I worked in advertising operations and yes, they are listening.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135025.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Im gonna speak in a little bit of a code so that maybe I dont get sued. I worked for a person who was the head of plastics for a company that kind of sounds a little bit like Ronson and Ronson. And when I was working for them, I walked into their home with a plastic container and they said, Take that out of my home right now.

And I was like, Hey, youre the head of plastics for Ronson and Ronson? Why would it be not okay to bring plastic into your house? And I was like, Its BPA-free. And they looked at me dead in my face and they were like, Take that out of my house now. There is no plastics allowed in my house whatsoever. BPA-free means nothing. It just means we replaced it with a chemical equally or more toxic that just hasnt been banned yet. And I will never forget that. Do with that information what you will, but I do not use plastics in my home when I can help it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135031.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I used to work for Starbucks a long time ago, and heres some secrets. Most of the time, we used to spell your name wrong on purpose. We just get told, Spell their name wrong. Theyll do free advertising for us. Youre going to put it on your social media, you are going to talk about it. If it goes viral, youve just done an advertisement for the company.

If youre rude to your barista, they will give you decaf coffee. Tastes the same. Youre just not going to get the coffee kick you need. Likewise, if youre nice to your barista, you are going to get stuff knocked off. They wont charge you for extra shots. They wont charge you for extra syrup. Theyll make your coffee beautifully. The love you give them is the love youre getting back. Look for the person with a black apron. Now, I dont know if they do this anymore, but those people are coffee masters. They have been trained to make beautiful coffee. They know what theyre doing. Theyll make it expertly.

Most of the staff will have tried all the foods and all that. So get them to make you something that they think is nice. Cause Im telling you, it is always a winning combination. Might not be on the menu, but theyll mix a couple of flavors together to make you something beautiful.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135032.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I have not seen anybody talking about Pandora. Okay. Pandora jewelry. When you shop at Pandora, youre literally shopping for sentimental value because theres not a single charm or a bracelet you can take to a pawn shop and actually get any cash back for it.

Theres so little gold in that jewelry that its worthless. Its all silver, its all cubic zirconia. You wouldnt find a Swarovski, a diamond, a crystal at all. In that store is all CZ stones that we find anywhere.

And two, it varies from franchise to franchise. I worked at a few, some are really good at being organized and stuff, but a lot of them - its dirty. They dont keep things up. You could probably look in between the things on the floor and you might find a charm underneath there, honestly, that filthy.

And we all steal, all the employees.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135033.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. So I used to work for Bath & Body Works, and this really isnt a secret, but I do get asked this a lot still to this day. And most of the employees should still be wearing a pin on their apron that says like a hundred percent guaranteed. But for those that keep asking, you can still return those old used products and tell them you did not like them and exchange them item for item. Even burnt candles, lotions, sprays, wallflowers, soaps. Yeah. All those. Just go in there and tell them that you did not like it. The fragrance, its not burning right, or you didnt like the lotion, whatever. They dont ask questions. They will let you exchange them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135034.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. I used to work at Victorias Secret. If you like the semi-annual sale, buy whatever you want, and then go back in 14 days and you can price adjust. They will let you do it (or theyre supposed to). They dont like it, but if youre nice, you can at least buy that much additional stuff now that everythings half off.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135036.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
