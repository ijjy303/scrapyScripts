## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">29 Stories Of Celebrities Being Jerks</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Ellen Degeneres is a bona fide b*tch. Incredibly rude. My Uncle worked with her, (hes an architect), on some projects and she treated him help like total crap. I couldnt believe it at the time, but Ive heard similar accounts of her bad behavior over the years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138714.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Oprah didn’t tip me on a $200 lunch — instead, she signed a napkin for me and acted like she was doing me a huge favor. The kicker was when she walked in, they gave away all of my other tables so she didn’t have to wait for anything. So I made $4/hour for two hours for the privilege of serving Oprah, and she went on and on about signing a napkin that I never asked for.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138711.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I haven’t met many but Lenny Kravitz stayed at the hotel I worked at. He had the hotel sign an agreement that the staff were not to look at him or talk to him. Snoop dog was cool. He left a bunch of booze and weed behind in his suite. The house keepers got a bunch of top shelf hootch and weed after he left.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138712.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Eminem. I was in Denver once and I was waiting for an autograph with my little brother. It was really cold and we waited for like 3 or 4 hours. He just said no.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138715.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. My wife worked at a hotel for many years and met literally every major celebrity you can think of. She said Snoop was the coolest person she ever met and Bill Clinton was the biggest douche even though I find it hilarious. My wife was walking outside back into the hotel, saw Bill and stared until she smashed herself in the face with a tree branch. Bill started laughing so hard he was having a hard time standing. The secret service ran over to help her and Bill, laughing so hard he could barely talk, told them to leave her because they had to keep walking. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138716.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. My dad is a pilot and he frequently deals with celebrities. His company has all the staff sign NDAs, but my dad usually doesnt even know who the celebrities are unless theyve been in the news. He said that Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are incredibly rude to their own staff. Personal assistants were terrified of them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138717.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Tyra Banks. This takes place when UPN and WB were merging into “The CW”. She comes into town for an ANTM cattle call. Demands we repaint the office she was going to use, (for three days), makes our pregnant programming director cry, flips her shot and tries to get me fired when I wouldn’t get her a bottled water. My response was “have one of your people get it, I have to get back to the board, commercial break is up in 40 seconds.” Opposite side, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are two of the nicest celebrities I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. We had just gotten “that 70’s show” in syndication and they came out for promo shoots. Super friendly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138719.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. William Shatner said he would give me an autograph in Hawaii when I was about 10 . He said ‘lemme get a pen’, got in his limo and drove off.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138720.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Randy Jackson. He was invited to a telethon hosted by a hospital for children with severe disabilities, where my little sister lived until she passed away. Whenever the cameras were off, he would hide in his hotel room and seemed disgusted with the kids. Didn’t want anything to do with them. When the cameras were on though, he was all smiles and hugs. It was so disheartening and disappointed. Almost 10 years ago and I still remember it so clearly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138721.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I met Ed Westwick from Gossip Girl at Coachella. I never watched the show, but I recognized him — he grabbed my slice of pizza, took a bite out of it, and then spit it out and gave it back to me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138722.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I was an extra on X men: Days of Future Past. They were all nice. Jennifer Lawrence was the one that was the more meh with other people. I dont blame her too much... Peak hunger game popularity at the time I get it. She was probably afraid people would try to always give her too much attention...However the other actors didnt care about that. The NICEST ones by FAR were Hugh Jackman and James McAvoy for what I saw. For McAvoy, one of my friend was one of the extras right behind him in a scene and we were shooting 14 hours a day in cooking 40 degrees enclosed green screen bordered set in bright sunlight. We were running in high heels and wearing winter jackets... Basically a hellish day. And we couldnt sit anywhere! Well McAvoy saw my friend wasnt doing right and he let her sit in Professor Xs chair and have a bit of his water bottle. And with that said, the dude would just talk and chit chat with everybody, despite the very strict non-conversation with actors contract we signed. Hes just so chill.Hugh Jackman literally signed autographs in between shots and high fived a bunch of people all the time. Michael Fassbender told all set workers passing by him after a very long day of work battling in water to have a nice day. I was a huge fan of his at the time and it made my whole year at that point.F*ckin Peter Dinklage was dancing disco during the heatwave day to cheer people up.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138713.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I’ve worked as a maintenance worker at a concert venue for a few summers and have bumped into several celebrities, but Carrie Underwood is the one who sticks out because of how demanding she always was. She refused to use a toilet if someone else had sat on the seat before her — cleaning them was never good enough, so we had to buy new toilet seats every time she came. Considering how much we already had to fix, the last thing we wanted to do was pointlessly replace perfectly good toilet seats. In contrast, Reba McEntire would always eat lunch with the staff and was always super chill.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138723.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. I worked with Gwyneth Paltrows children for eight weeks at a camp, and we got paid $5 an hour. Parents usually tip $100 or more at the end, but she didnt tip at all.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138724.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Madonna! She comes to my job few times a year. And every time she comes shes comes with 5-7 other people wearing a big hat, sunglasses and tries to blend within her friends or whoever they are. The people she travels with are so needy and always have some sort of special request to ask for. No thanks no nothing when they leave no tip and also leave a big mess. Cant stand them. No hi and no bye. Im like bye b*tch. Besides that a lot of the other celebrities are nice!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138725.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. My daughter was at a store in orlando and ran into LeBron James when he was with the Heat. 13 yo girl asked for a pic and he got pissy, told her she wasnt worthy of a picture with him, did she even know who he was, he didnt have time for this. Walked away leaving her crying so bought her an ice cream.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138726.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. I met a lot of celebrities while working for an airline, one of them being Hugh Grant. One time, he sat in First Class 1A on a 747 (which is right in the nose of the plane), so there was nothing but a wall in front of the seat. Its standard procedure for the cabin manager to go around to every first-class passenger and personally introduce themselves. When my manager got to Hugh, the conversation went something like this: Manager: Hello, Mr. Grant, my name is... Hugh: Oh, F*CK OFF. My manager proceeded to swiftly move on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138727.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Im from Vancouver, Canada (big film industry town), and a close family member of mine has worked in film here for 20 years, so I have too many stories to list. How about some rude ones, and some nice ones. Gerard Butler. Around nine years ago he insistently pursued a friend of mine at a club/lounge. She wasnt interested and told him so. Instead of respecting her wishes, he approached us, her friends, and attempted to get her number from us without her knowing. He would not respect her boundaries, or respect that no means no. Dedee Pfeiffer (Michelle Pfeiffers sister) attempted to have my female family member (crew member) fired from the movie of the week they were working on because Dedee was threatened by my family members appearance. This is not hyperbole. A producer told my family member Shes threatened by you because youre a petite blonde, like her, and youre outgoing and popular with the other crew members. My family member wasnt fired; Dedee was presumably told to cool her jets and focus on her job. Dedee Pfeiffers ego really is, apparently, that delicate that she cant handle another woman around her having any kind of positive attention. Later on in the shoot Dedee was purging in a set toilet (she is bulimic) and her gag reflex wouldnt stop gagging, so she passed out and an ambulance was called. David Duchovny circa X-Files. Frequent hissy fits on set, flipping garbage cans over, etc. Probably contributed 90% of Vancouvers stripper and escort income during the shows run. John Travolta. Kind, professional man on set. Arrested while here filming Look Whos Talking in Stanley Park for soliciting sex from an undercover male VPD officer and discretely bailed out of jail at 2am by a producer.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138728.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Okay, so a quick disclaimer first - this wasnt me, but my friend Dolly who was a flight attendant for a well known British airline until she died. Shed been with them since year dot, and as a result of her seniority would work in the First Class cabin. In her own words, she preferred it at the front of the plane, the nylon carpets at the back played havoc with her bunions.. ANYWAY, One day she had a British celebrity called Katie Price onboard. Ms Price is famous for... umm.. having boobs and falling out of various bars, I think. So, Ms Price comes on board, spots Dolly, and proceeds to spend five minutes listing her demands for the flight - namely that she should have total privacy, that anyone coming near her should be escorted away, that no crew approach her unless she calls them, and that Dolly herself would be held responsible if she was bothered at all, heads would roll, etc..Dolly waited for her to finish her demands, and then said Certainly madam. And you are.......?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138718.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I’ve worked with Nicki Minaj before and while on a set with her, I was told not to look at her face. She also had people move out of the room before she would come in the room. It was a whole ordeal.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138729.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. When I was about 7 years old in the 70s, I was at the airport with my mom and her boyfriend and a friend of mine — my moms boyfriend told us that Evel Knievel was in one of the lounges. He was sitting in a back corner, drinking a glass of some kind of booze, and engulfed in a cloud of cigarette smoke. My friend and I approached him excitedly, and after he autographed some napkins, he looked at us and said, Before I give you these, Im going to teach you something. My friend and I looked at each other totally starstruck, and grinned like idiots. Evel proceeded to tap both of us on the arm and asked, Does that hurt? and we both shook our heads no — then he poked us lightly on the chest and asked, Does that hurt? and again, we both said no. Then he made fists out of both of his hands with the middle knuckles sticking out, and brought them down sharply and simultaneously onto both of our heads. Does that hurt? he asked, and neither of us could answer — I was holding back tears from the pain. He waited a few seconds and said, Thats why you wear a safety helmet, and then handed us the napkins.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138730.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. EASILY John Mayer and its not even close. If youve ever thought John Mayer was cool, know this; John Mayer is a whiney man-child that just wants to smoke weed and watch South Park and play Call of Duty all day. Met him at an awards show thing about 10 years ago. WOULD NOT STOP quoting some sexist joke from South Park. Everybody around was just laughing awkwardly because it was weird. Also every word out of his mouth was a sarcastic joke, but like a MEAN sarcastic joke about somebody that I was supposed to find funny. But they werent funny. They were just weird. And mean. Got mad at me and called me a butthead when I didnt laugh.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138731.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Peter Mayhew aka Chewbacca. I accompanied my friend to a comic-con, who’s hobbies include getting autographs and photos of celebrities.He was very short with us and didn’t care we were fans at all. He interrupts my friend in the middle of complimenting him for his work, stating the costs of a photo and an autograph. Fine. We ask if we can take a photo instead of one his photos he selling and he tells us we’ll still pay the full price of one of his photos. Also fine. As my friend goes to walk around the table to stand side by side, he shouts at us to stay on the other side of the table. So we try our best to not look insulted, and take a super awkward picture of an annoyed Mayhew and my friend trying to lean back to make it look like they are posing for a fan pic.We try to thank him right after but he brushes us off as soon as we hand him the cash. D*ck. In contrast, we met Margot Kidder aka Lois Lane. She was super nice and even let us take pictures pretending to be flying with her like in the movie! And it was her suggestion, too!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138732.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Tim Duncan - Former Basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs. I met him at a Walgreens Pharmacy in San Antonio. I was trying to get batteries but he was getting batteries too. He was in my way. So I said “excuse me, could I just get through really quick- ”He stopped me mind-sentence and said “Nah, I don’t take pictures. Just let me do what I gotta do.” “My bad. I’m just trying to-“. “Hey, look. I don’t want to take pictures right now so just stop. ”He left. I got my batteries.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138733.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Neil deGrasse Tyson. I worked at the bookstore in college, and would pick up extra shifts working late night events when I had time. NDT was giving a speech, and holding a little meet and greet afterwards. I signed up to run a table selling his books. After his speech, he comes in to the hall where Ive got my table set up. He comes over, introduces himself, and asks which of the 2 books I liked better of his. 20 year old me has no idea who is he and didnt read either book, so I replied I actually havent read either. Im just picking up an extra shift for the store. Well then he starts a 2 minutes rant, berating people my age for not being interested in science, didnt know who he was, blah blah blah. He finishes, I gave him a dumb blank stare, and he walked away. Talked down to me in a way that just made me feel like sh*t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138734.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Busta Rhymes came into the jersey shop I managed in Atlanta and got pissed off that I didn’t have a hat in his size. He called me a dumb f*ck - which hurt because I was a huge fan of his going way back to Leaders of the New School. Same store - Tyler Perry said he would “buy me and sell me” after I told him that the OnField 5950 Yankee hat was dark navy blue and not black - even though he demanded a “black Yankees hat like they wear on the field”. Snoop Dogg, Michael Vick, Terrell Owens (esp Terrell Owens, and Birdman were cool as f*ck.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138735.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Pierce Brosnan. Saw him loading his car up at a farmers market in Santa Monica. Walked up to him and told him I was a big fan. I didnt ask for a picture or anything. He got into his car and as he was backing up he told me to f*ck right off. Maybe I was in the wrong for walking up to him, I was just excited.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138736.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. I was in Las Vegas airport on a layover. I was reading Give Me the Damn Ball by Keyshawn Johnson. I was 14 or 15 at the time. Behind me at the airport convince store? Keyshawn Johnson. 14 year old me is super excited. He just signed with the Cowboys and I was a huge Dallas fan. I quietly said Im a big fan, and Im reading your book from behind big sunglasses he looks at me and says leave me the f*ck alone. I was crushed. In a moment of hate I screamed Its Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Keyshane Johnson and walked away. By contrast I watched a Packers/ Vikings game with Mike Ditka at JFK airport and he was awesome.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138737.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Aziz ansari. Absolutely full of himself, zero self awareness. Literally forces himself into conversations with no understanding that he isnt wanted there.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138738.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Samuel Jackson. Was walking around NYC around 17 or 18 and who do I see in the corner of my eye, but Mace Windu himself Kango hat and all. I was nervous about going up to him but I proceed to watch a young woman go up to him, show him her head shot, and take a picture with him. After he does this I have the confidence to strike so I stroll up and ask Are you Samuel Jackson? and he is like Nah so I proceed to ask Are you sure? Im pretty sure you are Samuel Jackson and he says Nah you got me confused with someone else and walks away. I was a massive fan before and now I will always associate him with that memory.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138739.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">26 People Who Did Petty Things For Revenge</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Driver gets mad about traffic and gives me the finger.I was driving home from work on the freeway one late afternoon. Like a typical day in Los Angeles, there was a lot of traffic. I’m driving along and there’s this minivan behind me that starts tailgating me. It’s not like I can go any faster so I ignore it. Then the car proceeds to start honking. Still nothing I can really do. The driver than cuts to the lane next to me, rolls down her window, starts yelling and gives me the middle finger. I usually ignore stuff like this, but I was pretty annoyed at this point so I rolled down my window. I point at her tire while she’s yelling at me and yell “You have a flat.” She’s still yelling at this point so I say it again. She’s shocked and proceeds to pull off to the side. I watch her in my rear view mirror from a distance as she gets out to inspect her perfectly fine tire.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139415.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Small revenge against hoarders.Saw a couple who had filled their trolley with toilet roll arguing with an elderly couple who had asked for one packet because there wasn’t any on the shelves and they’d ran out. These 2 were a right piece of work and being quite abusive to the elderly couple. I went over to the elderly couple and told them to finish their shopping and that I would come and find them. They go off and arsehole couple carry on what they’re doing. When their backs are turned I grab 2 packets out of their trolley, go and find the elderly couple and give it to them. I then went and found a shop assistant and told them about arsehole couple being abusive to the elderly and when they get to the checkout their trolley is taken off them and they’re escorted out by security. This has made me extremely happy.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139402.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. You say dogs barking is just what dogs do huh?I had a neighbor that had a dog that I s**t you not, barked from bout 7pm til 5am NON STOP. They worked nights I believe. They kept it outside. I knocked numerous times, and they said: Dogs bark, what do you expect?Their house was directly behind mine, we shared a divided wall. I recorded their dog for a full day. The minute they brought him in, and felt like they were sleeping, I popped my phone into the dock and played it on my stereo full blast facing their yard at 9am.They came over raving mad to my wall by about 12, asking me to shut my dog up. I said Its your dog, I recorded him, since you miss out on what dogs do. Im just playing the radio at normal allowable city time and I will do this everyday.They started bringing the dog in at night after that.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139403.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Say goodbye to your cheque!Short and sweet - I was waiting in line at the bank. They have you line up outside, not a problem. This particular day it was a bit windy, again not a problem... for me.A guy gets out of his car, cheque in hand. You know where this is going, ha. The wind whips the cheque from his hands and somehow I managed to step on it as it scooted by me.I wasnt really expecting a thank you to be honest, but what I definitely wasnt expecting was the guy to chew me out for dirtying up his cheque. Thanks for stepping on my cheque, the bank probably wont accept it nowCall me an asshole but I lifted my foot up and let it blow away in the wind down the street and said well they definitely wont accept it now.The guy flipped his s**t as he was chasing it down the street and I got called up as next in line. Sorry not sorry.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139404.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I have a friend whose pumpkinfall display at the end of his driveway would be run over by the neighborhood jerk. happened every year. my friend decided to put a stop to it.he withdrew money from his savings account so he would have enough to buy the largest punkin he could find, along with several large bags of Quikcrete. filled that puppy up and made a real pretty display.the jackass broke the axle of his shotty car when he hit that pumpkin. could not drive away. my friend had his car towed away, too.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139405.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. My roommate enjoys nice long showers in the morning using all of the hot water. I realized that he literally jumps out of bed and runs into the bathroom when he hears my alarm. I started putting my alarm on silence for a while and this was working well enough but I still missed my morning shower several times because of their unreasonable long showers. So I just started moving to two alarms one alarm about an hour and a half before I normally get up. This has caused him for about two weeks now to get up really early run the hot water out and be out with enough time for it to be warm again. Small victories are nice.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139406.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Neighbor wont turn his flood lights off.Some years ago we had some new neighbors move in next door. Nice enough people but we had a problem with them. The husband traveled a lot and his wife was afraid of just about everything, the dark, thunderstorms, you name it. The problem was the flood lights over their garage doors. She would leave them on all night, every night, even though you couldnt see them from inside of their house. They were positioned such that they would shine into our bedroom at night. We were not able to block them effectively with our curtains. We asked them politely several times if they could turn them off at night since they served no effective purpose. They adamantly refused. I offered to pay for a timer that would control them. No way they would consider it. I thought about taking the bulbs out, shooting them out with my pellet gun, etc. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139407.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">The solution that I arrived at was to simply loosen them up enough that they wouldnt come on. Since they couldnt see them from inside the house it was about 5-6 months before they realized that they were not working. They screwed them back in. I waited a couple of weeks and unscrewed them again. Another few months went by. Finally, one day, my neighbor asked me if I ever had any trouble with my outdoor lights. I told him yes, as a matter of fact I did. I said that they would loosen up occasionally and I would have to retighten them. I blamed it on vibration from the traffic on our street. He said that he had the same problem. I told him that I finally just gave up and left them off. He eventually did the same. We were happy with the final outcome and we were able to keep peace in the neighborhood.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139408.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. You can have the furniture but Im taking the hex keys & screws!My ex and I broke up. We lived together. I sold most of my furniture to keep his, and we used that money to buy new things for the apartment like decor & bar stools for the kitchen. He not only wanted to keep all of his furniture, but 50% of the stuff we bought together. Tried to explain that everything became ours 50/50 when I sold my stuff to keep his. It wasnt worth fighting over, he was being pretty vindictive, so I said f**k it and let him take it all. I ended up with a desk, a rug, 2 bar stools, and some kitchen & decor items. He took all the electronics including TV, couch, coffee table, tv stand, bed & bedframe, etc. All of the really important and/or expensive items. He also returned all the gifts he got me for Christmas/my bday, but kept his Christmas gifts (more like, left me the boxes but took the items out of them).My petty revenge... Most of the furniture was Ikea. All of it being built with hex keys. I helped him disassemble his furniture for the movers. Then, I took his entire bag of hex keys & hardware (the screws and whatnot). He put the furniture in storage so he wont notice for another month at least. Replacing the hex keys is pretty simple, but good luck tracking down the exact screws and brackets and etc!!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139410.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. My mum and her friend had a massive fight, and my mums friend sent a letter to my mum scolding her and pretty much saying Were no longer friends and my mum, as an Ex-Teacher, took out a red pen, corrected all the spelling mistakes and grammatical mistakes, and mailed it right back to her</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139411.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. So, you wanna snoop in your daughters texts?So Im married to a wonderful woman. Shes smart, funny and very kind.Her mother is generally very nice and tends to have a great attitude and be very enjoyable, a bit of a prude but generally enjoyable, however can be a bit of a major snoop. If my wife leaves her phone sitting around she will just pick it up and start going through it. My wife has kind of laughed this off as a remnant of her mom being controlling when she was a kid.Im not a fan of this because my wife and I will sometimes text about thing that simply dont involve her mother and I dont feel are hee business at all.So over Christmas my I saw my wife set her phone down on the kitchen counter and I had a brilliant idea. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139412.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">Her mom was still in the kitchen and I sent my wife the most sexually depraved text about all the things I was going to do to her when everyone left. (Honestly most of them are things we havent even done, but I had to make it extra scarring ...)I sent this text from the bathroom. And maybe it was my imagination but I could swear I could hear an audible ghasp shortly after her phone went off.When I went out her mother absolutely would not look me in the eye. Then not-so-discreetly asked her daughter to come talk to her in the other room.When my wife came back into the living room I thought she had been crying, however upon closer inspection she was laughing. Her mother had questioned her about me sexually abusing her and if I always talk down to her like that.My wife had told her kindly that what we do is between us and us only. Probably the best gift this christmas.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139401.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Mom won’t believe nsfw site was popup ad, son “shows” her it can happen to anyone.When I was a kid my mom caught me looking at a porn site and I claimed it was a popup but she clearly didnt believe me. A few days later when she wasnt looking I pulled the same site up on her work laptop and hid it behind her browser window and pretended to catch her in the act when she closed her browser and the porn site showed up on her screen. She was flabbergasted and claimed it was a popup and I was all yeah right because that apparently doesnt happen and she apologized for not believing me before.I was f***ing diabolical</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139413.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Take my parking spot?? What goes around comes around.This may be the pettiest thing I have ever done.So in my city there is a pub thats attached to a doughnut shop that serves the best doughnuts in the city (which always causes a long line). Because its attached to a pub, it doesnt close shop until 9PM as there is a solid flow of business rolling in.Anyway, my girlfriend and I get a serious hankering for some snacks so we decide to head to the doughnut shop and arrive out around 8:30 P:M by car. Now, there are only three parallel parking spots a little up the street from the place, and they are all 15-minute spots which are usually full. We see up the street that, count our lucky stars, a spot is free! My girlfriend pulls a little ahead of the car in front of the spot, turns on her indicator, and begins backing into parking spot when this little white vespa driving behind us whips into the spot. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139414.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I roll down our window and call out to the driver Scuse me, we were just backing in. The driver seems to be a pretty univ student who shrugs her shoulders and calls out to me sorry, first come first serve! while her and her friend share a good laugh.My girlfriend suggests we just get doughnuts another time, and I tell her she can drop me off here, Ill buy the doughnuts since I know what she likes, and she can loop around. She agrees, and I pop out of the car, pass the little white vespa where the girls are still gathering their things, and head to the shop. As always, the line is super long for doughnuts and since this is the last batch, the doughnuts are slim pickins. The girls are behind me looking at the 5 or so different flavors that are left, talking about which ones are best and which they havent had yet. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139416.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">I hear one of them jokingly mention thank god we got a parking spot and they burst out laughing. I get to the front of the line, and when asked for my order, request two dozen doughnuts, which is every last one remaining. The girls behind me didnt listen to what I ordered, but eyebrows of confusion started to form on their faces and they slowly saw each doughnut loaded into the boxes and their options dwindle.One of them (the driver) in desperation asked the baker who was loading them in what, youre not even gonna save a few for us though? to which I turned around and said sorry, first come first serve. She honestly looked like she just simultaneously solved a movie mystery and s**t her pants, its difficult to put into words but truly an expression I can never forget.Best doughnuts I ever tasted (and enjoyed by the rest of my office the next morning)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139417.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Teacher denies bathroom privilege, student asserts his dominance.I originally posted this as a comment on another post, but my SO thought it was worth sharing as a standalone. Im adding a bit more detail and correcting some spelling and grammar. Also, posting from mobile, so apologies for formatting. Context: This happened in the early 90s and at the time the teacher had been teaching for 30 plus years. It was a rural area, so many of my friends parents had also suffered through at least one year of primary school with this awful woman. Ive seen a grown woman cry recounting memories of her experiences --she was really that bad.My second grade teacher took pride in being a mean old cunt to her students. Wielding control over our tiny little bladders was something that gave her a particular satisfaction. One day during cursive lessons this kid named Joseph asked to use the bathroom. She told him he shouldve used the bathroom during morning recess and would have to wait until lunch. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139409.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">A little while later he started squirming in his seat and again asked to use the bathroom, this time with more urgency. At this point our teacher starts berating the kid by telling him he is a little baby for not holding his bladder like a big boy and suggesting that he should wear diapers. Joseph gets tired of her s**t, stands up from his seat, stares her directly in the eye and proceeds to unleash the most epic man-sized piss he could muster. As fate would have it he was wearing those mesh material basketball shorts so the piss just flowed unobstructed down his legs and pooled on the carpet beneath him. A wave of giggling quickly spread through the classroom, which was basically the second grade equivalent of a slow clap. Our teacher just stood there dumbfounded for a moment before grabbing Joseph by the arm and dragging him off to the principals office. As they exited the room Joseph glanced over his shoulder with a big grin on his face.A legend was born that day and we all enjoyed our newfound bathroom privileges for the remainder of the school year.

<span style="font-size:4em">14. I put a fake note on a Corvettes windshield that read Sorry I hit your car, you probably wont even notice the damage because it was taking up four spots.So title is fairly self explanatory but Ill elaborate. I was trying to find a parking spot at my university. The lot was notoriously crowded but my campus didnt have a lot of options. While searching, I saw a Corvette taking up FOUR prime spots near the front of the lot. After about ten minutes of waiting/looking for a spot one opened up towards the back of the lot. Furious at the nerve of the driver being so inconsiderate, I wrote a note saying, Sorry I hit your car, you probably wont even notice the damage and left it on their windshield. When I got out of class and was headed back to my car, I saw a very stereotypical college aged Corvette owner frantically searching their vehicle while yelling into their phone. I dont know who they were talking to, but I feel bad for them having to deal with this person.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139419.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Neighbor took my parking spot after I shoveled. I poured water in his windshield.It was a cold winter day. 8 inches of snow had fallen the night before, and the windchill made it feel as if it were in the negatives (Fahrenheit). I drive an all wheel drive SUV so I have no issues getting out. My wife on the other hand drives a Prius, which slides with the smallest amount of moisture on the road.My car was down at the time, so we had to take my wife’s car. I spent 45 minutes in the freezing cold shoveling that car out so we could get to the store. We were gone for an hour, and when we came back, our neighbor had taken the spot I had shoveled.Our apartment complex doesn’t have assigned parking, but in the winter, it’s understood that if you shovel a spot, it’s yours. So when I saw his car in the spot I had just shoveled, I was pretty pissed.I went inside and filled two gallon jugs of water. Went back out and poured them on his windshield. Rinse and repeat. I must have poured about ten gallons of water on his car. Being how cold it was, it was already freezing by the time I poured the last gallon on. It sat like that overnight.The next morning, I got to watch as he helplessly tried to scrape all of these layers of ice off his windshield.Don’t take my goddamn parking spot.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139420.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. I published a poem about my ex in a literary magazine hed been trying to get in to for years.We were both in high school, and at the end of the relationship he told me he was just in it for the sex that he didnt really mean any of it, and that I obviously just wanted him because I was horny. He then went and had a hot and heavy make out sess with my best friend and came back and told me I was a bad kisser compared to her. Yeah, he was a jerk.Well, flash back to a few months previous. I was angry at him because he was being really hot and cold and so I wrote an angry poem about him. The magazine he had been trying to get into had a website and would publish poems based off of popularity on the website. He had gotten me to join a few months previous and I only had a few poems up. I decided against posting it then because it would be too mean.Well after he had pulled that s**t I decided I wanted a little revenge. So I posted the poem. And suddenly it was getting A LOT of popularity. And I get a notification from the magazine saying they want to publish it. So what was the first thing I did? Messaged him that I got published in this magazine. He got excited for me and congratulated me, until... he read the poem.Several million people have read the poem in the magazine, and to this day, he still hasnt gotten published.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139421.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Dad got decade long revenge on my aunty.A little set-up: My dad is one of 9 children to my grandparents. When the oldest sister (my aunty) lets call her Margaret got married, one of the gifts she received was four very poorly made clay pots from one of her friends who wasnt super close to the family. They were all very different to each other and didnt match at all. I assume they came out of a first-timers pottery class or something.Anyway, fast forward 15 years and my parents are getting married. Margaret shows up at the wedding. As does everyone else. The ceremony and reception pass with no dramas and everyone goes home.The following week my parents begin to sort through all their wedding gifts. Unwrap Margarets to find a very old worn-looking cardboard box with the old tape still underneath the new tape put on there by Margaret to hold the lid closed. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139422.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">Dad opens the box to see the 4 pots that had been given to Margaret 15 years prior. My parents knew this was a gift to Margaret originally because at the bottom of the box was a cord of congratulations on your wedding... addressed to Margaret. She hadnt even bothered to take the pots out of the box when she was gifted them or checked the condition when rewrapping them. This thoroughly pissed off my dad.Then his anger turned to determination as he started to develop a plan that would stretch almost a decade.With Christmas fast approaching my dad rewrapped the pots in the same box with the same wedding card addressed to Margaret. essentially in the same condition he had received it in. He then wrote another card addressed to another of his siblings explaining his plan. He gave the present to the youngest of his siblings, the newer card explained that she was to hold on to the pots until the next Christmas, making sure to unwrap it and make sure that everyone could see the pots in one way or another. the card then explained to leave the wedding card in the box and to not let anyone see it. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139423.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">My aunty would then hold on to the box, pots and card until next Christmas. She would then gift them and my dads note to the next sibling above her in age (my uncle). This cycle would repeat another 8 times until it reached the oldest sibling. Margaret. In my dads letter, it instructed the last sibling before Margaret to not give her the letter written by him regarding the plan.9 years after giving the gift away. My dad and all his siblings watched as she pulled out the pots that she had seen being passed around from sister to brother to sister for the last decade. She then noticed the note still in the box. She opened it and a category 4.2 earthquake was registered as her jaw hit the floor.Now, most people would expect her to erupt in rage but Australians have some of the best senses of humour on the planet. The family all had a good chuckle about it and moved on to Christmas lunch. The pots are now separated. one going to my dad, Margaret, my grandparents and the last being the trophy of the annual cricket game. It was sadly destroyed by a rouge ball in that very same yearly tournament and is now only half a trophy.Hope you enjoyed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139424.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. We were kids staying at the seaside on holiday with our family. My little sister would always make a pretty sandcastle, and the next day it would have been kicked down and shed cry. We wanted to find out who was doing it, so one day we stayed behind to spy. We watched as a bunch of jerk older boys came by and kicked her castle down, laughing smugly. So the next night, we covered a big beach rock in sand and decorated it. Like clockwork, the jerk kids came with their smug faces and this time kicked a solid rock with all of their might. The yowl and the look on their faces was the best revenge ever.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139425.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Grumpy neighbors ruined my birthday, my dad never let them enjoy their backyard ever again.Just came across this sub & thought of this story instantly.We are going a ways back here, think I was 8yo so that puts this story in the late 90’s.I grew up on a busy street in a suburb, all the houses are basically right next to each other.On one side of the house we had the grumpiest most miserable old couple in their 70’s as neighbors.We have a big family & enjoyed cook outs during the summer months. They hated us having parties & we weren’t even doing anything out of the ordinary. Just the type of people that would bitch about basically anything for no good reason.Well it’s my 8th birthday party & we have our typical big family get together. Well my favorite gift that year ended up being a globe trotters basketball. We had a hoop & had a blast playing around. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139426.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
