<span style="font-size:4em">3. COMMUNICATION IS THE KEY TO EVERYTHING. Seriously, if theres an unanswered question, f*cking mention it and get the answer. Neither men nor women are mind readers. So many things can be avoided by just talking with the other one in the relationship.Always assume ignorance over malice. Chances are whatever happened its because of assumptions made and not because one was trying to actively hurt/annoy the other. The only dumb question is the one you dont ask.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87184770.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Actually, the most valuable thing I’ve learned is to be honest. If I’m going to the pub and know I’ll be back late, just be straight up and tell it like it is. Most girls like honesty (seems fairly obvious doesn’t it). The relationship I’m in now has been by far the best because I don’t try to play games which has got me into trouble in the past. Honesty and transparency. It’s the key.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87184773.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Im female, but my male partner had no idea that women cant hold in our periods like we hold in pee.I found this out when he was telling me about a girl in 6th grade who got her period in class, and he couldnt believe how she just let it all out all over (as if she peed in her pants but it was period blood).I had to explain to him how it works. But I guess, how would he have known? I never thought about it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87184778.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

The store owner said hell no and it went to court for weeks. All the while the city was charging a huge fine every single day the painting stayed. A couple of the local millionaires kept paying the fine. They didnt care about the painting. They just liked the drama and like to stick it to the city. eventually the toy store lost and now its just a huge ugly brick orange wall in the middle of downtown. Us locals still talk about now and then.

Thankfully the fountain was off for the winter, so there was less damage, but they still have no clue how, and how much money its gonna take to fix this mess.

Farmer finally drove by and called the land owner to see if he knew about it, which he did not. Hearing that he approached the vehicle until he was about 20ft away and noticed a burnt body next to it. He then called 911. Nothing was known about who it was till a missing person was reported later that day, car and body were so burnt no identifying could be done immediately.

Two cameras caught the whole thing from local farm grain bins. Video showed the car in the field and then light moving as if it was stuck and trying to get out.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Nothing current but I have a great one from 5 years ago: So we had a guy who was quite the Libertarian. He owned a gun store in town and pretty much kept to himself. He will be known as LibGuy. The problem started when he decided to have chickens for his own eggs but he lived within the city proper which had a rule against farm animals within the city (this is a rural farming area I live in).

<span style="font-size:4em">
One of the city council members (he shall be known as A-hole) discovered he had chickens a few weeks after he got them and the city sent him a letter telling him he had to get rid of them. Well, he was not going to go down without a fight. So he spent some time looking into things and discovered the A-hole who reported him lived within the city and he also had chickens. Well, this of course caused a bit of a scandal. The city ended up claiming there was a grandfather clause for anyone who had livestock within the city prior to the rule change 17 years ago.

The problem with that was that clause applied to the A-holes father, not the A-hole who lived at the same address. Needless to say, the war was on! A couple of weeks go by and the town cops are messing with Libguy over petty sh*t. Libguy somehow gets a recording of A-hole calling the police and lying to them about what Libguy was doing. Police now want to charge Libguy for some absurd ridiculous recording law that really doesnt apply since it was someone with the police dept who gave him the tape not that he stole it.

This gets blown up to the point where the bigger cities news crews are now showing up to city council meetings that are being called to address this issue. These meetings are getting absurdly blown out of proportion and in all honesty somewhat slimy in how the city is handling it. Libguy subpoenas the city council emails to show there was a concerted effort to f**k with him and cover for A-hole. Well in the course of getting the Emails it was discovered that there was a sexting issue going on between three of the city council members. LMAO, believe me when I say this did not involve people that would be considered sexy. All three (2 women and 1 male) were married, 200lbs plus, and in their 50s. I mean Emails about double-dildos, pegging, swinging...etc..It was hilarious. In the end, the Libguy got the last laugh.

He lost his chickens but found a loophole where he could actually own Llamas in the city since they were not considered livestock. So he put up a fence all around his yard (ugly chicken wire fence) just tall enough so the Llamas could not get out by jumping. People actually would go by walking their dogs and pet the Llamas. The problem though was that Llamas sh*t like cows and it stinks in such a small enclosure. This went on for about a year until he sold his house and moved (it stunk for at least a block around his property and he lived right behind the towns grocery store). Two of the council members involved got divorced over the sexting issue and the third one sold her bar because of it. This was the infamous chicken scandal that plagued my town of 4K for 3 years.” - blgiant</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185861.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

And he has zero plans to actually turn this into a functioning business. It’s about half done, no landscaping, and construction vehicles parked all over the place.

A woman posted in the local neighborhood Facebook group to say a woman had knocked on her door at 6:25am. The reason was she had tracked her missing husbands phone to the address. He had not come back the night before. The man was not there and the poster was a bit concerned. This led to much chat about burglaries and whether she should post the ring doorbell footage. A man then joined the thread to apologize. It was the missing man. He had got drunk at the football game and ended up falling asleep in the house next door to the woman who posted on Facebook.
