## <a href="#linky5" id="linky4">24 Things Guys Never Knew About Women Until Getting In a Relationship</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. That birth control messes with their hormones a lot.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87184769.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. COMMUNICATION IS THE KEY TO EVERYTHING. Seriously, if theres an unanswered question, f*cking mention it and get the answer. Neither men nor women are mind readers. So many things can be avoided by just talking with the other one in the relationship.Always assume ignorance over malice. Chances are whatever happened its because of assumptions made and not because one was trying to actively hurt/annoy the other. The only dumb question is the one you dont ask.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87184770.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Makeup is expensive as f*ck.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87184771.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Actually, the most valuable thing I’ve learned is to be honest. If I’m going to the pub and know I’ll be back late, just be straight up and tell it like it is. Most girls like honesty (seems fairly obvious doesn’t it). The relationship I’m in now has been by far the best because I don’t try to play games which has got me into trouble in the past. Honesty and transparency. It’s the key.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87184773.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Until I actually lived with my partner it was hard to comprehend just how often a period comes, how long it lasts, and how much it can affect your day-to-day.What a pain in the ass. I do not envy the ladies.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87184774.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Im female, but my male partner had no idea that women cant hold in our periods like we hold in pee.I found this out when he was telling me about a girl in 6th grade who got her period in class, and he couldnt believe how she just let it all out all over (as if she peed in her pants but it was period blood).I had to explain to him how it works. But I guess, how would he have known? I never thought about it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87184778.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

The store owner said hell no and it went to court for weeks. All the while the city was charging a huge fine every single day the painting stayed. A couple of the local millionaires kept paying the fine. They didnt care about the painting. They just liked the drama and like to stick it to the city. eventually the toy store lost and now its just a huge ugly brick orange wall in the middle of downtown. Us locals still talk about now and then.

Farmer finally drove by and called the land owner to see if he knew about it, which he did not.

Nothing was known about who it was till a missing person was reported later that day, car and body were so burnt no identifying could be done immediately.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Nothing current but I have a great one from 5 years ago: So we had a guy who was quite the Libertarian. He owned a gun store in town and pretty much kept to himself. He will be known as LibGuy. The problem started when he decided to have chickens for his own eggs but he lived within the city proper which had a rule against farm animals within the city (this is a rural farming area I live in).

One of the city council members (he shall be known as A-hole) discovered he had chickens a few weeks after he got them and the city sent him a letter telling him he had to get rid of them. Well, he was not going to go down without a fight. So he spent some time looking into things and discovered the A-hole who reported him lived within the city and he also had chickens. Well, this of course caused a bit of a scandal. The city ended up claiming there was a grandfather clause for anyone who had livestock within the city prior to the rule change 17 years ago.

The problem with that was that clause applied to the A-holes father, not the A-hole who lived at the same address. Needless to say, the war was on! A couple of weeks go by and the town cops are messing with Libguy over petty sh*t. Libguy somehow gets a recording of A-hole calling the police and lying to them about what Libguy was doing. Police now want to charge Libguy for some absurd ridiculous recording law that really doesnt apply since it was someone with the police dept who gave him the tape not that he stole it.

This gets blown up to the point where the bigger cities news crews are now showing up to city council meetings that are being called to address this issue. These meetings are getting absurdly blown out of proportion and in all honesty somewhat slimy in how the city is handling it. Libguy subpoenas the city council emails to show there was a concerted effort to f**k with him and cover for A-hole. Well in the course of getting the Emails it was discovered that there was a sexting issue going on between three of the city council members. LMAO, believe me when I say this did not involve people that would be considered sexy. All three (2 women and 1 male) were married, 200lbs plus, and in their 50s. I mean Emails about double-dildos, pegging, swinging...etc..It was hilarious. In the end, the Libguy got the last laugh.

He lost his chickens but found a loophole where he could actually own Llamas in the city since they were not considered livestock. So he put up a fence all around his yard (ugly chicken wire fence) just tall enough so the Llamas could not get out by jumping. People actually would go by walking their dogs and pet the Llamas. The problem though was that Llamas sh*t like cows and it stinks in such a small enclosure. This went on for about a year until he sold his house and moved (it stunk for at least a block around his property and he lived right behind the towns grocery store). Two of the council members involved got divorced over the sexting issue and the third one sold her bar because of it. This was the infamous chicken scandal that plagued my town of 4K for 3 years.” - blgiant</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185861.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

He had not come back the night before. The man was not there and the poster was a bit concerned. This led to much chat about burglaries and whether she should post the ring doorbell footage. A man then joined the thread to apologize. It was the missing man. He had got drunk at the football game and ended up falling asleep in the house next door to the woman who posted on Facebook.

<span style="font-size:4em">1. “Expect that Im not up to whats going on in the Internet. I was in my late 30s, when a friends son tried to explain me memes. He got them wrong too.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185074.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. “Act like 30+ is old AF. Honestly itll be on you before you know it and youll still feel 25 at 40.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185075.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. “Took a job working at a Mcdonalds cleaning, as a favour to my mothers manager. Wow are kids brutal when youre my age working in a position like that, you become the punchline to all their funnies as Or youll end up like him! Ive never had a reason to think about folding a kid in half til I had to deal with it 40 hours a week.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185076.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “Act like they invented something, or discovered a brand new thing when they have the internet and can look up exactly where and when said thing came from. My roommate told me a young co-worker of hers was dressed in early 2000s fashion and when she told the coworker she had that same outfit in high school the coworker replied, No they just started making this last year. I told her I remember dressing very 80s in my late teens, but I was fully aware that I was copying 80s fashion, and I feel like Gen Z kids dress like its the 90s/2000s but they think its brand new like they invented it.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185077.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “I’ve heard 20 year olds say “I hope I die before I have to turn 30.” I wish them the best of luck.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185078.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “The look of astonishment when anyone finds out our age. I’m in my late 30s. When someone in their 20s hears that, they developed this look of shock likes it’s the 1500s and I should have died already from old age.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185079.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. “Im 45 and I still play video games. I grew up in the 80s and 90s. Video games is all. So when some kid gets in our party chat (xbox) and starts chewing me out or making fun of me cause Im old and shouldnt be there it ticks me off. Like what are you gonna do when youre 45 kid? Tell the house robot to leave you alone while you play more call of duty vr?”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185080.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “Im only 29 but I hate that young people try to exclude us from fandoms, saying were too old for that. Life doesnt just stop at 25 and not all of us want or have kids and partners. Let us enjoy things!!!!”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185082.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “Act like theyve experienced more than us. Im only 33 but wow, the amount of 16 to 22 year old that talk down to us is absurd.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185083.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. “I’m 35 and young people seem to be both more sensitive and simultaneously RUDE as heck! I don’t understand, being sensitive should make you more kind :(“</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185084.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. “Send emails like a text or a dm. Youre contacting me about a problem, and I know that from the fact that youre emailing me.

Give me some details to work with up front so I dont have to go back and forth with you all day.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185088.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. “Sneering at younger kids or their own peers for being cringe. I promise you that youre as cringy as they are, its just going to take you ten years to realize it.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185089.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. “This is trades specific. Im 36, and Ive been practicing my trade for 16 years. If youre 18-21 years old and ask me how to do something, then turn around and do the exact opposite of what I suggest, then quit wasting my time. Im here to help you learn, if youre not willing then find somewhere else to be.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185090.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. “Im 55 and I love playing Fallout. Then when I mention it to my classes (physics teacher)... I get the You play games? exclamation. Yes, Sonny.
