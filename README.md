## <a href="#linky4" id="linky3">25 Movies Both Disturbing and Beautiful</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Empire of the Sun. This movie wrecked me as a kid (I was about the same age as the protagonist). Went back and watched it as a father, wrecked me again. That ending is an absolute gut shot.-u/Spodson </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87137679.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Perfect BlueI watched it because I heard that it was Aronofskys inspiration for Black Swan (also beautiful yet disturbing).

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Fargo. Incredibly violent, but very intriguingly wholesome in a way that captures everyday humanity at its best and worst.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Grave of Fireflies My husband lends this to everyone who will take it because it hit him so hard.

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Requiem for a Dream. I was just at the beginning of my decade-long heroin addiction when I watched it. F*cked me up. But apparently not enough.

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Blue Velvet Disturbing for obvious reasons and beautiful for the absolute mastery that Lynch displays in the writing and directing. The pace and tone are so tightly controlled that the movie has left me stunned with every viewing. Absolute masterwork.-u/so_sads</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87137691.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. What Dreams May Come. Yes! This movie is stunningly beautiful visually. The story is very hard and sad but very well done.

<span style="font-size:4em">19. The Road. Incredibly bleak, depressing, and morbid but so beautifully made and resembles the book SO well. Easily one of my favorite movies. The way it captures the desperation and horrible things humans can do to one another but also highlights our innate instinct to push forward and survive (for better or worse). I love that movie. Definitely not a casual watch though-u/justalittlesadIguess</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87137697.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Swiss Army Man. It opens with Paul Dano riding Daniel Radcliffe like a jet ski propelled by his farts. Which is absurd. But it also ends with Daniel Radcliffe riding off into the sunset like a jet ski propelled by his farts. And it is beautiful.-u/These-Square8340</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87137699.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Jacobs Ladder I saw this in the theater, on a day pass from a mental hospital where I was being treated for BPD and PTSD. I sat and cried like a child for ten minutes while the credits rolled. F*cked. Me. Up.Still one of my all-time favorites.-u/MetaJonez</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87137700.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Dr. Curt Richter conducted an experiment with rats that essentially concluded that the presence of hope could prolong the ability to stay alive when faced with life-threatening circumstances.During the first part of the experiment, rats were put in a bucket of water. After about 15 minutes the rat would begin to drown. The scientist plucked the rat out of the bucket of water merely seconds before death. After a couple of days, the scientist repeated this process. However, instead of drowning after 15 minutes of treading water, some of the rats survived for up to 2 and half days.The scientist concluded that the rats were able to continue swimming because they retained the HOPE of being rescued, as this is what they experienced during the first trial.It would be interesting to see how the concept of hope influences humans under similar circumstances.-u/Public_Bullfrog_382</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87138197.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Id like to see an experiment where a child is brought up believing a fictional piece of work like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings is a real religion.Think of it like the Truman Show, but instead of a show its just a household that worships Nic Cage or something.

<span style="font-size:4em">18. My brother and I have talked a lot about a special version of the Olympics where the competitors can use whatever and however many performance-enhancing drugs they want just to push the absolute limits of what humans can do.

## <a href="#linky10" id="linky9">35 Pieces of Knowledge That Feel Illegal to Know</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Read a personal finance book that recommended calling your providers once a year (credit card companies, TV/internet providers, cell phone company, etc) and demand a lower rate or price. I’ve been following that advice for two years and have not been denied once.

Last week I saw a commercial for my internet provider offering a super low introductory rate so I called to demand that I get that rate. They said no problem and now I save an extra $700 a year because of a 5 minute call. I am a very passive introvert so it’s not the most easy or comfortable thing but the money I save is worth it. They may so no initially but if you ask a few times or ask to speak to their supervisor they very usually give in.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138062.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. In Canada you can record any conversation with someone without their knowledge, unless it is in furtherance of an offence.

I had to do this with an auto restoration shop in order to do a Visa chargeback when they did nothing to my car but steal parts for almost a year (Curtis Customs in Nova Scotia - I don’t mind mentioning them because there are already news stories about their scams)</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138073.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. When I was a kid, my dad taught me how to pick a lock. I became very interested in different kinds of locks and purchased a lock pick set. I practiced for years and became pretty good at certain types of locks. So over the years every now and then, if a neighbor locks themselves out of the house or a friend loses the key to a padlock or a lock box I’ve been able to help. But the reactions I tend to get from people, even while I’m helping them with their lock is mainly one of mistrust. I’m not a cat burglar. I just like locks.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138056.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Unionization saves you more money than it costs you, you cannot be punished for attempting to do so, and it is NOT in any way illegal, rude, or improper to discuss your salary with your coworkers.

It feels illegal because every company on the f*****g planet has tried to make people think unions are evil monsters trying to get you to pay union dues for no return. This is false because union dues are much less expensive than a company underpaying you and trying to work you to death, which a union fights against. Unions are there to prevent worker exploitation, stop it if people were being exploited when they got there, and get you a fair wage that will actually let you live off of one job instead of needing 4-5 or to work criminal amounts of overtime.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138060.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. When you have a debt with a collection agency you can pay the debt and then call back a few weeks later and say, “I was told when I called and paid that you’d remove this from my credit score.” And then you ask for documentation saying they’re gonna do it. Apparently collection agencies don’t keep super good records on stuff like that; they just want your money. It worked for me, and I hope it can work for you if you need it in the future.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138072.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. I had a stats prof who used to work for the US government. Im not sure exactly what his job was, but it definitely involved evaluating the status and readiness of nukes, both ours and the USSRs (he was probably at least 70 and had been retired from that job for a while). One day in class he just started talking about the percentage of nukes that fail (ours and theirs) and why they fail and all kinds of other, seemingly sensitive, information. I dont think he would have told us anything classified, but his personality was boisterous and irreverent enough that I am not sure.
