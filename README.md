<span style="font-size:4em">1. R. Lee Ermey, who plays Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket (1987), came up with 150 pages worth of insults for his role. Originally a technical advisor for the film, he took over after the original actor tired himself out after yelling for 30 minutes.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87139612.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The Predator (1987), the character of Predator was never meant to make the distinctive clicking sound.

## <a href="#linky9" id="linky8">Nic Cage Gets Candid Answering the Internet's Burning Questions</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Q - Who is your favorite character in all of literature and film? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/043143/87144050/east-of-eden.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

A - That is so hard to answer. I will say that James Dean’s performance as Cal in East of Eden is largely the reason I became a film actor. His role in that is one of my favorite characters in cinema. But then we can go all the way to Rasputin or we can go to Dmitri Karamazov. Dmitri Karamazov is one my favorite characters in literature. I love him so much because he’s so happy and he has no money. He’s just living it up. He spent all his money trying to get the girl. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/043715/87144052/download.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">


I did the same thing once. I was very Dmitri Karamazov in high school. The most beautiful girl in high school who was a grade older than me invited me to the prom but I had no money. My grandmother gave each of us a little bond. My older brother bought a car. My second oldest brother bought some stereo equipment. And I splashed out on a chauffeur-driven limousine, a tuxedo and a four course meal at Le Dome on Sunset blvd. The car was $2000, the stereo was $2000, and my prom night was $2000 and man, that was money well spent. THAT’s Dmitri Karamazov.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/043835/87144053/34017122-8807887-image-m-131_1601929849363.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Q: I have a 2 regarding the movie Willys Wonderland. Did you or the director decide that you would not say a single word the whole movie, and 2, every time you went to recharge (grab a can from 6 pack) was it secretly filled with alcohol or anything like that? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044016/87144055/image.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

A: The dialogue for my character in Willy’s Wonderland was very sparse, so I decided with Kevin, the director, to go full Harpo Marx and take all the dialogue out because I thought that would be a fun acting challenge to see how much I could communicate without words and only with movement and facial expressions. I’m very happy with the results of Willy’s Wonderland. It was a good experiment. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044156/87144056/the_unbearable_weight_of_massive_talent_229253.0.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

The can question is an interesting one, and I hesitate to answer it for you because your relationship with the movie is far more important than my relationship with the movie and so you as the audience member can imagine and surmise whatever you want to be in that can. That is a far better answer and reason for the can than anything I could tell you. I want YOUR opinion as to what was in the can, because that was the right opinion.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044416/87144058/merlin_190797741_3bd42c19-5686-46c9-b90d-99f6c84d2c13-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Q: You and Pedro seemed like you had so much fun making this movie; what is one story you don’t mind sharing that you haven’t yet about your experience with filming and working with Pedro? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044521/87144059/EB20040425REVIEWS08404250302AR.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: First and foremost, Pedro Pascal is a genuinely nice man. You couldn’t ask for a nicer more pleasant person to work with. Second, he has a very unique sense of humor. It’s the kind of sense of humor where I don’t know if he’s really making a joke or he isn’t making a joke. Such as comment about the appearance of a cabbage in a cabbage field. And it made me wonder if he was a method actor and was in character and adding a kind of confused dimension to the Javi role, or if he genuinely thought the cabbage was amusing. I am still confounded by this. I mean who makes a joke about cabbage, except him? It’s just not funny!

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Q: What has been your most challenging role to get into character each day to film? What is your favorite character that youve ever portrayed? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044732/87144065/1498576162376-cage12.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: I would say that Nick Cage in Massive Talent was the most challenging role I had to get into character for because I had the added component of trying to protect a person named Nick Cage and also facilitating the director’s absurdist vision of so-called Nick Cage and it was a highwire act every day. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/044931/87144066/343423131441.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

Again, Pig is my favorite performance of mine, and I think that movie, along with Scorsese’s Bringing Out The Dead are arguably my two best movies as a whole</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045052/87144067/MV5BMTMzNzA0MTUzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEyNzkwNQ@@._V1_.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Q: I know you have a love of the silent era, especially the German expressionist stuff. What’s your favorite silent film? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045208/87144068/52744-posts.facebook_lg.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: Boy that’s a hard list to conjure up because there are so many memorable ones but I would say that Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera comes to mind but Nosferatu, Schreck, his performance, and even Barrymore in Jekyll and Hyde. I think that Barrymore did more to inspire Schreck’s performance than the other way around. Oh, and anything Chaplin did was magic: City Lights, Modern Times. It depends on the season!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045410/87144069/05a.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Q: Pig was an absolutely incredible film, what drew you to that project, and why do you think that it struck a cord with so many people? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045541/87144092/1308201.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

A: Thank you. I was interested in returning to a more quiet, naturalistic style of film performance, having done a series of more operatic performance styles. The movie feels rather like a folk song to me or a poem, and the character of Rob was contending with tremendous grief and self imposed isolation and I think we as a group of people experiencing a pandemic in 2020-21 we’re probably also having similar feelings of loss and isolation and it communicated to a nerve we were all experiencing. Its one of my favorite movies, and its probably my best work.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045655/87144093/wild-at-heart-slide-1.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Q: Have you seen Leaving Las Vegas recently? I think that is my all time favorite Nicolas Cage performance. How do you feel thinking back on Leaving Las Vegas and your performance in it? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/045942/87144094/types-of-pasta-1581024990.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: Thank you. I think Leaving Las Vegas, Pig and Bringing Out The Dead are my three favorite performances of my own body of work. I have not seen Leaving Las Vegas recently, however that movie and Elizabeth Shue’s work in that movie are what I aspire to continue towards, and did continue towards with Pig, which is why I am always going to be up for small budget, independent, dramas.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/050203/87144095/1500386626-credit-melinda-sue-gordon.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Q: Ethan Hawke said that youre the first actor since Marlon Brando to do something new with the art of acting. Any thoughts on that? </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/04/12/050341/87144096/nationaltreasure_niccage1.gif" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

A: It’s very kind of Ethan to say so, as you may well know, I’ve worked with Ethan in Lord of War and have always been spellbound by his talent. I think many of the choices I’ve made have been inspired by film stars from the silent era as well as cultural expression of performance like Kabuki and some of the Golden Age actors like Cagney so I don’t know how to say I’ve done something new because those elements are always on my mind
