<span style="font-size:4em">1. Outrunning explosions - apparently you only have to worry about the flame, and the concussive impact is really minimal.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/07/19/043438/87219558/moviewrongs2.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. For the most part, HVAC ducts are not strong enough to hold a human, and they would not allow a person to traverse from one side of a building to another. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/07/19/043443/87219559/moviewrongs1.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Women in fights with long hair not pulled back.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/07/19/043502/87219562/moviewrongs5.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. How absolutely loud gun fire is especially in enclosed spaces. Hero in a concrete stairwell, no hearing protection, BANG BANG BANG! Then hears footsteps as someone sneaks up on them. Youd be deaf and ears ringing for a day after.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/07/19/043514/87219564/moviewrongs6.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Armor.

<span style="font-size:4em">13. The 80s. Turn on the radio in the 80s and you could well hear a song from the 60s. House decors were often a mix of the 70s and 80s.

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Birth. Some people are in labor for just a few hours, and thats very quick. The average labor lasts 12 to 24 hours for a first birth. And in movies the baby comes out clean, about 6 months old, and there is never a placenta.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/07/19/043627/87219577/moviewrongs22.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. The suppressor noise. They think it just screws on and voila! No more noise.

<span style="font-size:4em">23. The instant death neck crack. To break a neck, you will have to put 100/110% of your victim weight with your arms alone.

## <a href="#linky7" id="linky6">25 Things Annoying Tourists NEED To Stop Doing</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Dont carve your name on stuff! The number of people who need to carve their names onto historical buildings and statues is just crazy. Dont be a jerk. You are ruining the place. And respect peoples properties. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218748.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Going on the black rocks and being swept out to the Atlantic Ocean, risking the lives of first responders and locals many of whom are already traumatized from Swiss Air.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218749.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Deface world heritage sites for souvenirs or internet clout. For example: The Colosseum in Rome has graffiti carved into its walls by arsehole tourists and Stone Henge is closed off to the public because arseholes were chipping pieces off for souvenirs.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218750.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. For your sake, STOP TRYING TO PET THE BUFFALO! Or dont, some of us are entertained by the videos of you flying through the air.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218751.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Stop trying to hike up a mountain in flip-flops! Also, dont try to use an air mattress as a mode of transport between islands. Several of these every year... </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218752.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Stopping their cars in the middle of the road to take in a view. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218753.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Saying, “I paid a lot to be here,” or I’ll leave a horrible review.” Driving like a jerk, leaving garbage anywhere but a rubbish bin, stopping in the middle of the road to let out your family of 12 instead of pulling into the parking lot. I live in Hawaii and work only with tourists. Best yet, My company was asked to contact the cruise ship company to have them move the ship because it disrupted the sunset.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218754.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Driving drunk. I live in Sonoma County, California. Make sure you’ve got a sober driver. The roads around here are never more dangerous than winery tasting room closing time on a sunny weekend.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218755.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. In my hometown, it somehow became a thing that tourists would rent mopeds. So when you are trying to get to work, you often get stuck behind a flock of tourists on mopeds, riding at 20MPH in formation so you cannot pass them. We are infested with gawking tourists moped gangs. If they want to rent mopeds, at least go the speed limit, and ride in a manner that allows others to pass you.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218756.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Stop feeding the dang seagulls…</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218757.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Spain. We get a ton of tourists. The worst is littering on the beach, which is thankfully pretty rare. I occasionally see someone put a cigarette butt in the sand. A lot are taken away when they leave, but the sand has a way of hiding stuff, so a lot remains.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218758.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Allowing their kids to do whatever they want. Once a year my town has a weekend where the Boy Scouts take over the town camping down by the river, taking tours of the historic buildings etc. Every year most of the downtown shops will close for this weekend because of how much the Boy Scouts will steal or vandalize while there. Everyone that lives there dreads that weekend because the troop leaders just let the scouts do whatever they want.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218759.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Stop walking out into the middle of an active downtown street to take group pictures of yourselves in cheerleading outfits on the spot where Kennedy was shot.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218760.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Amsterdam. Walking around like theyre at Legoland, blindly stepping into traffic, oblivious to the fact that people actually live here. We use the bike to get to work, to get groceries, were not just aimlessly cycling around for the fun of it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218761.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Stopping dead in a crowd in the middle of the sidewalk. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218762.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Leave. The. Wildlife. Alone. And this doesnt just extend to tourists but to people that live here too. 45+ coyote attacks last year in no small part because of people giving them food leading to a cull, bears getting habituated to people because theyre being given food leading to them getting killed, otters and sea lions getting fed. Theyre not cute cuddly things. Theyre wild animals and will kill you.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218763.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Stop being a belligerent asshole just because you’re in “N’AWLINS.” It’s still not an excuse to get blackout drunk, litter, and make hell for food service workers.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218764.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Getting sh*tfaced / coked up and getting up in peoples business or picking fights with the doorman or bar staff. Or talk about weed and getting stoned the entire time. Or ask me where the Red Light District is while standing in the Red Light district. Or renting a bike when the last time you rode one was in preschool.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218765.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Specifically regarding Movie/TV Houses. Unless the house is a museum or has tours, its almost certainly someones home. Stay off their porch, dont walk through the yard, and STOP THROWING PIZZAS ON THE ROOF! The poor people who owned Walter Whites house had to put up a giant fence because the dozens of signs about it were being ignored.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218766.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. In New York, if you visit, please walk on the right side of the sidewalk, not the left. Also, if you need to stop and look at your phone or have a conversation with your fellow travelers, step aside. People are walking and if you abruptly stop it usually results in someone bumping into you. Also, do not walk like 5 people side by side and walking slowly. People cant get around you. It is infuriating. But, please keep visiting NYC! </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218767.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Allow the me from 20 years ago to take this opportunity to officially apologize for recreating the Abby Road picture with my friends during a college trip to London.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218768.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Stop laying down next to the stars on the Hollywood walk of fame! Hollywood is filthy. Oh you laid down next to your favorite star? Congratulations. You’re now covered in homeless person piss and jizz. You should burn those clothes.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218769.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Nobody likes your f*cking drone. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218770.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Caribbean island ... people who complain that they cant get a Heineken or a Bud Light here. People who complain that they cant get fast food or chain food here. People who basically are angry that a tiny island in the Caribbean isnt just like the Houston suburbs. If you want everything you have in the US, stay the f*ck in the US. Also infuriating during the pandemic: Your island requires masks and negative tests!? Well if you keep that up we will NOT be visiting and will take our money elsewhere! Fine. Go elsewhere. We dont want you on our island, where the entirety of our healthcare is a small clinic with five beds. Dont threaten people with money, f*cking entitled jerks.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218771.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Clean up your f*cking trash. I used to live in a spring break destination which was a small surf town. After spring break, people would be cleaning up pounds upon pounds of beer cans, broken bottles, needles, and used condoms. It was revolting.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87218772.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. I strongly suspect being a spy doesnt involve half as many high-tech gadgets and spontaneous sexual intercourse as Ive been led to believe.

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Anything in modern-day publishing. How many television shows and movies must I watch where the plucky young upstart graduates from college and gets a job at the magazine or newspaper of their choice and is respected and can make a living?

<span style="font-size:4em">
The pay sucks, youre in constant danger of being laid off (when your pub folds, usually), and its usually a pretty corporate environment where youre tasked with multiple jobs for little hope of advancement. The names high up on the mastheads are usually those of rich people, and its because they started off rich and could afford to stay in the industry.

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Working on a film. If youre crew, it sucks. long long hours for what seems like very very slow progress on the picture, lots of standing around waiting, etc. You arrive well before everyone else and leave after everyone else. If this is an indie production you also may have to beg/chase down for your pay at the end of each week. Oh, and when the film wraps, youre now unemployed.

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Being a therapist. Too many people Ive met get into the field thinking its how they saw it on TV: affluent white collar, own office, warm slow pace environment, where you get to sit on a nice comfy couch and be like lets talk about your feelings. Thats only if you get to private practice, which they dont tell you is also like running your own small business, which good luck is you have no business acumen.

The reality is you get out of grad school, get your first job working at a Community Mental Health facility because they are the only ones who will hire you with a limited license and no experience, getting paid less than $40k/yr if youre lucky, and then get put in a walk-in closet of an office, where they dump 100 client caseload on you the first day. Followed by your first client who has 5 different diagnoses and is on 12 different psych meds who says to you f*ck you, youre the 7th different person Ive had here, nobody cares about me. Yeah people go into $100k of debt for that...

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Anything in the music industry. Youre never really off the clock, the pay is terrible pretty much all across the board unless youre in the 1% of the top in any business. People think its all glamorous because they see the popstars, the music videos, the award shows. Truth is, its blood, sweat, tears, stress, lack of sleep, a lot of inappropriate behaviour, drugs (fun if you like it, not fun if you dont), alcohol (again: fun if you like it, not fun if you dont.)

And again: low pay, and then maybe once or twice a year you get a perk of going to an award show with free food, booze and a chance to say Hi to some celebs (cant even take a photo with them, really, as its not deemed professional in a work setting). Ive been there for 15 years give or take, branched out, still linked to it in some ways but I get my money (much better money, might I say) elsewhere now and without as much stress or worry.

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Most (not all) jobs in the environmental sector. Pay is usually quite low, you tend to work in very ugly places (landfills, contaminated sites). You are expected to get jobs done in half the time you really need with as few resources as possible. And if you are consulting for other companies, nobody really wants to be working with you to “save the environment” - they generally are just trying to barely meet some regulations.

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Anything that requires a lot of travel. Sounds glamorous but in reality, all you see is usually an airport, conference room, boring hotel room, and maybe a restaurant if you are lucky. It’s exhausting and it actually just sucks.

## <a href="#linky12" id="linky11">25 Alexander the Great Facts Your Teachers Never Told You</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. The body of Alexander the Great has been lost over time. It was well-known to be in Alexandria, Egypt for centuries, and was even worshiped for a while, but its exact location has apparently been forgotten.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217534.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. As a student of Aristotle, Alexander the Great was said to be a philosopher king, that is, a ruler who possessed both a love of wisdom, as well as intelligence, reliability, and a willingness to live a simple life. Such a king was the ideal ruler in Platos fictional utopian city of Kallipolis.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217536.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. When Alexander the Great defeated Darius III at Issus, Darius fled leaving his entire family to Alexander, including his mother Sisygambis. Alexander treated them well, and when Darius was killed Sisygambis did not mourn her son: I have only one son [Alexander] and he is king of all Persia.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217538.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Today I learned about Cynane, Alexander the Greats warrior half-sister. Unlike most women of the time, she was given a martial education, and led her own troops into battle. She slew an Illyrian queen in battle, defeated the army of one of Alexanders generals, and after she was killed by Alcetas, his troops rioted.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217532.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Centuries after Alexander the greats death, his tomb was a tourist attraction. Many of the Roman emperors who visited the tomb left with souvenirs, effectively looting the monument. According to one account, Augustus Caesar tried to touch the 300-year-old mummy, accidentally breaking its nose.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217533.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Alexander the Great once suffered an arrow wound that pierced his lung. He fought on as long as he could, but eventually collapsed on his shield. His army was able to protect him long enough to win the battle and to escape. They cut the arrow out of his chest and amazingly he fully recovered.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217535.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Alexander the Great encouraged his men to shave, so that enemies couldnt grab their beards during combat.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217546.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Alexander the Great once built a half-mile causeway through the sea to capture the impregnable Tyre island. The island has remained a peninsula ever since.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217537.jpeg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. In 346BC, Alexander the Great, at the age of 10, after taming a large anxious horse, was allowed to buy it. He named the horse Bucephalas, and he rode the horse until the Battle of Hydapes in 326BC when it died at the age of 30. Alexander later named a city after his steed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217539.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Roman historian Livy argued that Rome would have beaten Alexander the Great if he had lived long enough to attack the Romans. His digression is the oldest known alternate history.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87217540.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Although Cleopatra was born in Egypt, she wasnt necessarily Egyptian.
