## <a href="#linky6" id="linky5">29 Stories Of Celebrities Being Jerks</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Ellen Degeneres is a bona fide b*tch. Incredibly rude. My Uncle worked with her, (hes an architect), on some projects and she treated him help like total crap. I couldnt believe it at the time, but Ive heard similar accounts of her bad behavior over the years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138714.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Oprah didn’t tip me on a $200 lunch — instead, she signed a napkin for me and acted like she was doing me a huge favor. The kicker was when she walked in, they gave away all of my other tables so she didn’t have to wait for anything. So I made $4/hour for two hours for the privilege of serving Oprah, and she went on and on about signing a napkin that I never asked for.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138711.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I haven’t met many but Lenny Kravitz stayed at the hotel I worked at. He had the hotel sign an agreement that the staff were not to look at him or talk to him. Snoop dog was cool. He left a bunch of booze and weed behind in his suite. The house keepers got a bunch of top shelf hootch and weed after he left.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138712.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Eminem. I was in Denver once and I was waiting for an autograph with my little brother. It was really cold and we waited for like 3 or 4 hours. He just said no.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138715.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. My wife worked at a hotel for many years and met literally every major celebrity you can think of. She said Snoop was the coolest person she ever met and Bill Clinton was the biggest douche even though I find it hilarious. My wife was walking outside back into the hotel, saw Bill and stared until she smashed herself in the face with a tree branch. Bill started laughing so hard he was having a hard time standing. The secret service ran over to help her and Bill, laughing so hard he could barely talk, told them to leave her because they had to keep walking. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138716.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. My dad is a pilot and he frequently deals with celebrities. His company has all the staff sign NDAs, but my dad usually doesnt even know who the celebrities are unless theyve been in the news. He said that Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are incredibly rude to their own staff. Personal assistants were terrified of them.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138717.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Tyra Banks. This takes place when UPN and WB were merging into “The CW”. She comes into town for an ANTM cattle call. Demands we repaint the office she was going to use, (for three days), makes our pregnant programming director cry, flips her shot and tries to get me fired when I wouldn’t get her a bottled water. My response was “have one of your people get it, I have to get back to the board, commercial break is up in 40 seconds.” Opposite side, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are two of the nicest celebrities I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. We had just gotten “that 70’s show” in syndication and they came out for promo shoots. Super friendly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138719.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. William Shatner said he would give me an autograph in Hawaii when I was about 10 . He said ‘lemme get a pen’, got in his limo and drove off.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138720.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Randy Jackson. He was invited to a telethon hosted by a hospital for children with severe disabilities, where my little sister lived until she passed away. Whenever the cameras were off, he would hide in his hotel room and seemed disgusted with the kids. Didn’t want anything to do with them. When the cameras were on though, he was all smiles and hugs. It was so disheartening and disappointed. Almost 10 years ago and I still remember it so clearly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138721.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I met Ed Westwick from Gossip Girl at Coachella. I never watched the show, but I recognized him — he grabbed my slice of pizza, took a bite out of it, and then spit it out and gave it back to me.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138722.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I was an extra on X men: Days of Future Past. They were all nice. Jennifer Lawrence was the one that was the more meh with other people. I dont blame her too much... Peak hunger game popularity at the time I get it. She was probably afraid people would try to always give her too much attention...However the other actors didnt care about that. The NICEST ones by FAR were Hugh Jackman and James McAvoy for what I saw. For McAvoy, one of my friend was one of the extras right behind him in a scene and we were shooting 14 hours a day in cooking 40 degrees enclosed green screen bordered set in bright sunlight. We were running in high heels and wearing winter jackets... Basically a hellish day. And we couldnt sit anywhere! Well McAvoy saw my friend wasnt doing right and he let her sit in Professor Xs chair and have a bit of his water bottle. And with that said, the dude would just talk and chit chat with everybody, despite the very strict non-conversation with actors contract we signed. Hes just so chill.Hugh Jackman literally signed autographs in between shots and high fived a bunch of people all the time. Michael Fassbender told all set workers passing by him after a very long day of work battling in water to have a nice day. I was a huge fan of his at the time and it made my whole year at that point.F*ckin Peter Dinklage was dancing disco during the heatwave day to cheer people up.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138713.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I’ve worked as a maintenance worker at a concert venue for a few summers and have bumped into several celebrities, but Carrie Underwood is the one who sticks out because of how demanding she always was. She refused to use a toilet if someone else had sat on the seat before her — cleaning them was never good enough, so we had to buy new toilet seats every time she came. Considering how much we already had to fix, the last thing we wanted to do was pointlessly replace perfectly good toilet seats. In contrast, Reba McEntire would always eat lunch with the staff and was always super chill.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138723.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. I worked with Gwyneth Paltrows children for eight weeks at a camp, and we got paid $5 an hour. Parents usually tip $100 or more at the end, but she didnt tip at all.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138724.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Madonna! She comes to my job few times a year. And every time she comes shes comes with 5-7 other people wearing a big hat, sunglasses and tries to blend within her friends or whoever they are. The people she travels with are so needy and always have some sort of special request to ask for. No thanks no nothing when they leave no tip and also leave a big mess. Cant stand them. No hi and no bye. Im like bye b*tch. Besides that a lot of the other celebrities are nice!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138725.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. My daughter was at a store in orlando and ran into LeBron James when he was with the Heat. 13 yo girl asked for a pic and he got pissy, told her she wasnt worthy of a picture with him, did she even know who he was, he didnt have time for this. Walked away leaving her crying so bought her an ice cream.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138726.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. I met a lot of celebrities while working for an airline, one of them being Hugh Grant. One time, he sat in First Class 1A on a 747 (which is right in the nose of the plane), so there was nothing but a wall in front of the seat. Its standard procedure for the cabin manager to go around to every first-class passenger and personally introduce themselves. When my manager got to Hugh, the conversation went something like this: Manager: Hello, Mr. Grant, my name is... Hugh: Oh, F*CK OFF. My manager proceeded to swiftly move on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138727.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Im from Vancouver, Canada (big film industry town), and a close family member of mine has worked in film here for 20 years, so I have too many stories to list. How about some rude ones, and some nice ones. Gerard Butler. Around nine years ago he insistently pursued a friend of mine at a club/lounge. She wasnt interested and told him so. Instead of respecting her wishes, he approached us, her friends, and attempted to get her number from us without her knowing. He would not respect her boundaries, or respect that no means no. Dedee Pfeiffer (Michelle Pfeiffers sister) attempted to have my female family member (crew member) fired from the movie of the week they were working on because Dedee was threatened by my family members appearance. This is not hyperbole. A producer told my family member Shes threatened by you because youre a petite blonde, like her, and youre outgoing and popular with the other crew members. My family member wasnt fired; Dedee was presumably told to cool her jets and focus on her job. Dedee Pfeiffers ego really is, apparently, that delicate that she cant handle another woman around her having any kind of positive attention. Later on in the shoot Dedee was purging in a set toilet (she is bulimic) and her gag reflex wouldnt stop gagging, so she passed out and an ambulance was called. David Duchovny circa X-Files. Frequent hissy fits on set, flipping garbage cans over, etc. Probably contributed 90% of Vancouvers stripper and escort income during the shows run. John Travolta. Kind, professional man on set. Arrested while here filming Look Whos Talking in Stanley Park for soliciting sex from an undercover male VPD officer and discretely bailed out of jail at 2am by a producer.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138728.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Okay, so a quick disclaimer first - this wasnt me, but my friend Dolly who was a flight attendant for a well known British airline until she died. Shed been with them since year dot, and as a result of her seniority would work in the First Class cabin. In her own words, she preferred it at the front of the plane, the nylon carpets at the back played havoc with her bunions.. ANYWAY, One day she had a British celebrity called Katie Price onboard. Ms Price is famous for... umm.. having boobs and falling out of various bars, I think. So, Ms Price comes on board, spots Dolly, and proceeds to spend five minutes listing her demands for the flight - namely that she should have total privacy, that anyone coming near her should be escorted away, that no crew approach her unless she calls them, and that Dolly herself would be held responsible if she was bothered at all, heads would roll, etc..Dolly waited for her to finish her demands, and then said Certainly madam. And you are.......?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138718.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I’ve worked with Nicki Minaj before and while on a set with her, I was told not to look at her face. She also had people move out of the room before she would come in the room. It was a whole ordeal.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138729.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. When I was about 7 years old in the 70s, I was at the airport with my mom and her boyfriend and a friend of mine — my moms boyfriend told us that Evel Knievel was in one of the lounges. He was sitting in a back corner, drinking a glass of some kind of booze, and engulfed in a cloud of cigarette smoke. My friend and I approached him excitedly, and after he autographed some napkins, he looked at us and said, Before I give you these, Im going to teach you something. My friend and I looked at each other totally starstruck, and grinned like idiots. Evel proceeded to tap both of us on the arm and asked, Does that hurt? and we both shook our heads no — then he poked us lightly on the chest and asked, Does that hurt? and again, we both said no. Then he made fists out of both of his hands with the middle knuckles sticking out, and brought them down sharply and simultaneously onto both of our heads. Does that hurt? he asked, and neither of us could answer — I was holding back tears from the pain. He waited a few seconds and said, Thats why you wear a safety helmet, and then handed us the napkins.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138730.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. EASILY John Mayer and its not even close. If youve ever thought John Mayer was cool, know this; John Mayer is a whiney man-child that just wants to smoke weed and watch South Park and play Call of Duty all day. Met him at an awards show thing about 10 years ago. WOULD NOT STOP quoting some sexist joke from South Park. Everybody around was just laughing awkwardly because it was weird. Also every word out of his mouth was a sarcastic joke, but like a MEAN sarcastic joke about somebody that I was supposed to find funny. But they werent funny. They were just weird. And mean. Got mad at me and called me a butthead when I didnt laugh.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138731.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Peter Mayhew aka Chewbacca. I accompanied my friend to a comic-con, who’s hobbies include getting autographs and photos of celebrities.He was very short with us and didn’t care we were fans at all. He interrupts my friend in the middle of complimenting him for his work, stating the costs of a photo and an autograph. Fine. We ask if we can take a photo instead of one his photos he selling and he tells us we’ll still pay the full price of one of his photos. Also fine. As my friend goes to walk around the table to stand side by side, he shouts at us to stay on the other side of the table. So we try our best to not look insulted, and take a super awkward picture of an annoyed Mayhew and my friend trying to lean back to make it look like they are posing for a fan pic.We try to thank him right after but he brushes us off as soon as we hand him the cash. D*ck. In contrast, we met Margot Kidder aka Lois Lane. She was super nice and even let us take pictures pretending to be flying with her like in the movie! And it was her suggestion, too!</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138732.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Tim Duncan - Former Basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs. I met him at a Walgreens Pharmacy in San Antonio. I was trying to get batteries but he was getting batteries too. He was in my way. So I said “excuse me, could I just get through really quick- ”He stopped me mind-sentence and said “Nah, I don’t take pictures. Just let me do what I gotta do.” “My bad. I’m just trying to-“. “Hey, look. I don’t want to take pictures right now so just stop. ”He left. I got my batteries.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138733.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. Neil deGrasse Tyson. I worked at the bookstore in college, and would pick up extra shifts working late night events when I had time. NDT was giving a speech, and holding a little meet and greet afterwards. I signed up to run a table selling his books. After his speech, he comes in to the hall where Ive got my table set up. He comes over, introduces himself, and asks which of the 2 books I liked better of his. 20 year old me has no idea who is he and didnt read either book, so I replied I actually havent read either. Im just picking up an extra shift for the store. Well then he starts a 2 minutes rant, berating people my age for not being interested in science, didnt know who he was, blah blah blah. He finishes, I gave him a dumb blank stare, and he walked away. Talked down to me in a way that just made me feel like sh*t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138734.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. Busta Rhymes came into the jersey shop I managed in Atlanta and got pissed off that I didn’t have a hat in his size. He called me a dumb f*ck - which hurt because I was a huge fan of his going way back to Leaders of the New School. Same store - Tyler Perry said he would “buy me and sell me” after I told him that the OnField 5950 Yankee hat was dark navy blue and not black - even though he demanded a “black Yankees hat like they wear on the field”. Snoop Dogg, Michael Vick, Terrell Owens (esp Terrell Owens, and Birdman were cool as f*ck.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138735.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. Pierce Brosnan. Saw him loading his car up at a farmers market in Santa Monica. Walked up to him and told him I was a big fan. I didnt ask for a picture or anything. He got into his car and as he was backing up he told me to f*ck right off. Maybe I was in the wrong for walking up to him, I was just excited.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138736.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. I was in Las Vegas airport on a layover. I was reading Give Me the Damn Ball by Keyshawn Johnson. I was 14 or 15 at the time. Behind me at the airport convince store? Keyshawn Johnson. 14 year old me is super excited. He just signed with the Cowboys and I was a huge Dallas fan. I quietly said Im a big fan, and Im reading your book from behind big sunglasses he looks at me and says leave me the f*ck alone. I was crushed. In a moment of hate I screamed Its Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Keyshane Johnson and walked away. By contrast I watched a Packers/ Vikings game with Mike Ditka at JFK airport and he was awesome.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138737.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Aziz ansari. Absolutely full of himself, zero self awareness. Literally forces himself into conversations with no understanding that he isnt wanted there.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138738.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Samuel Jackson. Was walking around NYC around 17 or 18 and who do I see in the corner of my eye, but Mace Windu himself Kango hat and all. I was nervous about going up to him but I proceed to watch a young woman go up to him, show him her head shot, and take a picture with him. After he does this I have the confidence to strike so I stroll up and ask Are you Samuel Jackson? and he is like Nah so I proceed to ask Are you sure? Im pretty sure you are Samuel Jackson and he says Nah you got me confused with someone else and walks away. I was a massive fan before and now I will always associate him with that memory.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87138739.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
