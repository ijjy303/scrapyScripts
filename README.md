As of late, Ive been finding nails, screws, and scrap metal in the driveway past where they ever drive their vehicles. I try to avoid conflict, but its starting to get out of hand.

This one day Im working on my motorbike out in the shared car park, when the mother turned up in her Ford Ka and parked next to my parents car. She got out of her car and proceeded to smash her car door into my parents about 8 or 9 times while smiling at me. Her nickname was Psycho Sally for a reason. - slawter_uk</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129274.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Had a neighbor leave a note on my then-girlfriends car saying she wasnt allowed to park in front of their house because their taxes paid for that part of the street. That same neighbor constantly called the cops on me for trivial things like one time I was shoveling my driveway and I moved my car onto the sidewalk for 5 minutes while I shoveled the spot where it was previously parked. Pretty much every discussion I had with the cops involved the cop making fun of how stupid the people were for calling to complain. - DobRex</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129275.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. The Duke lacrosse guys. Rich, over privileged white frat bros who beat and raped a black stripper they had hired to perform at their frat party. Because of course they did, it was obvious. Lock em up and throw away the key.Except it never happened. The woman made it all up. They were presumed guilty, and were treated as such by the media.Charges were eventually dropped, but not before the accused and sustained extreme damage to their names, reputations, and, surely, mental health. Eventual fallout would include the prosecutor getting disbarred for fraud, and Duke University settling with the guys for $20 million each. The stripper? Several years later, she would be arrested and convicted of murder after stabbing her boyfriend to death.

<span style="font-size:4em">3. I convinced myself that I could really walk and it was just mind over matter, and despite my boyfriend and friends telling me not to, I rose up from my wheelchair and promptly fell under the pub table. I was covered in bruises, and I had a sore bum for days. My boyfriend and his best mate had to retrieve me from under the table. - Blackcat1206</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129235.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Not dumbest but laziest. I microwaved something and when I opened the door to get it, because it wasnt centered on the turning plate, it was a bit further from the door. So I closed it and restarted the microwave another 5 seconds to get it closer to me so I didnt have to reach so far back to get it. - Mathinpozani</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129236.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. One night I go in the backyard to get high. I leave the backyard lights off so that my older neighbors can’t see what I’m doing cause I’m immature like that lol. I got a glass of ice water in one hand and I stepped into my pitch black backyard.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Every time I move I hear a sound like there is an animal stalking me in the many bushes in my backyard. Whenever I stop the sound stops but once I start moving again it sounds to me like the leaves in the bushes in our backyard are rustling and there is an animal in them. If I try to go back toward my back door the sound follows me. If I move further into the backyard the sound follows me.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Almost gave myself hypothermia. While on a hike I picked up a big a** rock to throw onto a frozen lake and break the ice.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Once I was eating a burrito like a ravenous beast and straight up bit my own finger. Another time I was gaming and my hands were cold, as I can get bad circulation.

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I got super blazed one night near the beginning of pandemic lockdown, and went across the street to the drugstore to get some chips and such. As I approached the automatic glass doors I saw a person standing on the other side, so I waited for them to come through. I stood there waiting for what felt like an eternity. I was getting frustrated, like “what’s up with this clown? Cant they see I’m waiting for them?” Then i realized it was just my reflection. - hemingward</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129251.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky13" id="linky12">15 Hilarious Things Kids Have Asked Their Teachers</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. The time a fourth grader asked me to show him my dong. Loudly. In front of his entire class. I’m a music teacher. And a female. He meant he wanted to see a gong. - urbancowgirl42</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129197.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. One child called another lil hot dog and the victim was utterly distraught. I somehow managed to convince him I was crying because its such a mean thing to call someone. - insignismemoria</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129198.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. My first year teaching, I was going over the parts of a parabola. So I had my boring ole parabola up and I drew a dot at the vertex. Some kid goes, that is the easy one to remember, its the nipple of the titty. I had to keep facing the board for a bit so push back the smile. - Makenshine</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129199.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. We were playing a phonics game. There were two teams; one person from each team had to say a rhyming word of the word that I said. I said “pick”, a student said “dick”. I’m thankful the rest of the class didn’t know what that was. - uwubutcuter</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129200.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Field trip instructor. I was leading a discussion on food chains with some 4th graders and asked what we call animals that only eat plants. The answer I got was virgins. - Evolving_Dore</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129201.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. I had a kid who got extremely angry because I told him that he couldn’t do something (don’t remember what). He started stomping and screaming and became so angry that he dropped his pants and stood there in his underwear glaring at me. I wanted to laugh so bad but it would have just pissed him off more and that would not have helped the situation. - talibob</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129202.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I’m a history teacher. We were looking in the textbook at a section on the founding fathers. Several of them had their own subheadings and a little paragraph about them. Like this: George Washington (1732-1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), Benjamin Franklin (1707-1790), I then have a student raise their hand and ask, completely serious, “If you call these numbers, do they still work?” She thought their birth and death dates were their phone numbers. I teach high school, the class lost their shit, and it took everything in me to keep a straight face. - snapdown91</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129203.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Fifth grader told me he wanted to be a doctor when he grew up so he could make babies. I changed the subject. - wubbzyove</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129204.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. When I taught first grade kid #1 says kid #2 said the B word. I inquired what was the B word? Kid #1 says Bagina. Had to clench my teeth together to keep from laughing. - CA_catwhispurr</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129205.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I used to teach English to Korean kids. They had to do some writing and one wrote about their pet cat. The family called it pussy. The whole piece was about how much his dad likes pussy. - Stowford164</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129206.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I teach English to Japanese kids, alongside a native Japanese teacher, and one day they asked me the English word for 白菜 (hakusai), which I now know is like, Chinese cabbage or napa cabbage, but I didnt know at the time and ended up using google translate on the big PC screen in the front of the class. For some reason, the English traslation came up as white rape (???) and I guess the Japanese teacher mistook my baffled reaction as an inability to prounce the word or something, because before I knew it he hit the lil audio button and white rape was being spoken aloud to the whole class. It was such a surreal moment and I was the only one in the room that could appreciate the absurdity. I had to just play it off like, Uhhhh, nope, thats not it! Lets uhh, lets just move on... Pretty sure that memory will be in my life review when I die. - atttaraxia</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129207.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I used to teach 3rd graders (non-native English), and one time one of them ran up to me to tattle on his classmate and said Teacher, Teacher, Tunwa just said FUCK YOU!!!, so Tunwa, who was running behind him goes No teacher, no!! I only said FUCK I didnt say *looks around and starts to whisper* ...you... I was like, No, no! Thats not the bad word, its the other one!, but I was dying, I had to turn around and go laugh behind a corner. - nickbkk</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129208.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. We were doing a lab testing density of objects - including wooden, rubber, and styrofoam balls. In the middle of class a student loudly yells out, “Stop touching my balls!” I legitimately couldn’t breathe for a minute. - AJEstes</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129209.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. dont know how my teacher kept a straight face on this tbh.... history teacher would always say lets get quizzical when we had a quiz. one day we had a test so my friend raised his hand oh Mr m dont you mean lets get testical? teacher just said  you can do that on your own time Brian as our 8th grade class lost our shit. - themoonhasgone</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87129210.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
