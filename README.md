## <a href="#linky2" id="linky1">25 Pieces of ‘Life Advice’ That Are Total Bullsh*t</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Pretty much anything about what age you have to be to like buy a house, have kids, get married, have a career or anything like that. Seriously every person lives a different life than everyone else. Live your life the way that makes you happy. If you want. Up to you. -u/Ginger-Beefcake</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154780.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. But they are family! I didnt know being related stopped people from being a**holes. On the flip side, if were family, why are you treating me like sh*t in the first place? -u/KaiJonez</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154777.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Money doesnt bring happiness. Maybe not but with it, I can pursue the things that make me happy. -u/creekupwood</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154778.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. “Kill them with kindness. F*ck that, sometimes a person needs to be told what’s up. -u/Jimwish32</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154779.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. “Cheaters never prosper.” Yes they f*cking do. -u/Quadric0rn</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154781.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Live every day as if its your last. No. That encourages people to keep up all kinds of terrible habits because YOLO. -u/ErisianMoon</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154782.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Dont be depressed, there are other people doing worse than you. Thanks, I know that and try to help them sometimes. But that wont help my depression leave just because I compare myself to other people having a worse life than me. -u/Scarmaster21</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154788.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Telling people Its all in your head. -u/my_gender_is_a_glock</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154783.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Nope— not true. Some things leave you permanently changed, and not always for the better. Yes, it is possible (and oftentimes a good thing) to try and find silver linings regarding crummy situations. But to completely ignore how something may hurt someone is absolutely foolish. -u/itsgoodpain</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154784.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. “Ignore the bullying and it will go away.” Like wtf is that logic? If you are actively letting bullying happen to you it will only get worse (in my experience.) -u/kianstartedskating</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154785.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. Youre not married because youre too picky. So Im supposed to settle just so I can be married? You better believe Im going to be picky when it comes to the person Im going to interconnect everything with for the rest of my life. In fact, I know more married people that are in unhappy marriages because they werent picky enough. Better to be single than with the wrong person. -u/CamaroNoir</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154786.png" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “Never settle. Reach for the stars.” Sometimes knowing your limits is a good thing. Otherwise you may refuse something good because you’re trying to get something that’ll never be possible. -u/macaronsforeveryone</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154787.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. “Do what you love” and its close cousin “Follow your dreams. The best counter advice or aphorism I ever got was from a former boss: “Work is work. If it were fun, they’d call it something else.” -u/gorillamagnet</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154789.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Anything involving the idea of “soulmates” can really set you up for a big fall. -u/FishingOk3283</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154790.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. “Just get over it. Most people would if they could. -u/AJSK18</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154791.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Everything happens for a reason. Tell that to a mother who lost her son to a drunk driver. -u/XizaanxvMohX</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154792.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Never go to bed angry. When youre tired and cranky, thats not the best time to solve your problems. Get some sleep, clear your head, and talk about it in the morning. Preferably after breakfast, so youre not hangry. -u/Forsaken-Economy-416</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154793.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Any husband advice that means he just lays down and rots as long as it keeps his wife from whining. Happy life happy wife. If youre right and she’s wrong, she’s right.  F*ck that advice so hard. -u/deleted</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154794.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. Telling people they are beautiful on the inside does more to convince people that beauty is important than it will convince them that they are actually beautiful. If someone is beautiful on the inside because of their compassion, just call them compassionate. -u/Black-Thirteen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154795.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. The customer is always right. I dont work retail or anything, but whenever I go shopping, I see a lot of customers verbally abusing store associates. Its terrible. -u/yamsnavas2</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154796.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. You can grow up and be whatever you want. -u/SenpaiGandalf</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154797.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. Hard work = success. -u/IamJeffreyW</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154798.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. That going to college will “guarantee you a high paying job. I heard that sh*t all my childhood and it just absolutely is not always true. Trade school degrees that are way cheaper can pay more and give you a better chance at a job. Wish someone would have told me this 15 years ago. -u/Minion0827</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154799.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. No pain, no gain. Sometimes sh*t hurts and you should see that as a sign to back off or get some help. -u/fullchargegaming</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154800.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. “Respect your elders.” F*ck that. You’re not entitled to my respect just because you’re old. If someone expects me to treat them with respect, they should at least be respectful as well. -u/thenexthefner</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87154801.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky4" id="linky3">32 Stupid Rules That Backfired Epically</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. My company has a strict no-alcohol policy. You cant begin work within 10 hours of having had a drink.

So whenever theres a staff shortage and they need me to come in right away, guess who just cracked open a cold one?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153647.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. One summer in Sweden, bus drivers in some counties started wearing shorts due to the heatwave. After being denied to continue doing so by management, they started wearing skirts instead. Dress code policy had banned shorts, but not skirts.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153648.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. When a daycare started charging a small fine for parents who picked up their children late. Instead of resulting in more on-time arrivals, the new policy actually caused more late pick-ups. This is because the parents were originally worried that a late pick-up would be a significant burden on the daycare employees, but because the fine was so small (only a few dollars), they decided that it must not be a big inconvenience for the daycare.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153649.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. One of the high-rise blocks I have to maintain has a sign saying Anything left here will be removed due to it being a fire risk. People just dump the s**t there they dont want like fridges and sofas and by law, we have to take it</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153650.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The previous school I worked at decided that all shirts needed to have the school name or emblem (which was a fancy letter E) on them to be dress code appropriate. Thats all the handbook said. No clarification on how the name or emblem was designed or the color or if it had to be permanently affixed to the clothing. The students hated the policy and, being in high school, looked for any loophole possible. They found one due to the lack of clarity of the handbook policy. The kids would make paper Es and pin them to their shirts. Thus, they could wear whatever they wanted and by pinning the E to the shirt, were still dress code compliant. I thought it was pretty genius. The administration did not.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153651.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. My work has an infraction system. If youre a minute late thats half a point, if youre up to four hours late thats half a point. So if youre going to be a minute late you might as well be four hours late because its the same penalty.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153652.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. The middle school wanted to create a trash-free environment so they removed the trash cans from the parking lots, halls, and cafeteria. Then just told the kids to toss your trash when you get home or in a classroom

The amount of litter skyrocketed overnight, after a week or so they brought back the cans.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153653.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Air pollution became a big problem in late-80s/early-90s Athens, mostly due to the number of old, heavily-polluting cars on the roads. So the Greek government made a law where only cars with odd-numbered final digits on their number plates (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, etc.) could be driven on odd-numbered days (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.)- and only evenly-numbered cars could drive on evenly-numbered days. Sounds great doesnt it, theyll halve the number of cars on their roads right - nope, they doubled it - everyone bought one old, highly-polluting car that had an odd-numbered plate and another with an even-numbered plate - nobody could park and the air was worse than before.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153654.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. In French Indochina, there was a major problem with rodents eating supplies and bringing disease. Given the plentiful supply of cheap unemployed workers, the colonial authorities thought they could be used to kill the rats and bring their numbers down. The French had a somewhat racially prejudiced view of the work ethic of the locals, so decided to pay them per rat killed rather than per hour worked. Each was compensated for every dead rat they handed over.

A year or so later, the colonial authorities discovered the peasants had set up rat-breeding farms in the jungle.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153655.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Zero Tolerance Policy for no violence at school. Punishing the victims for getting bullied... yea, THAT was a smart idea...</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153656.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. When Domino’s said all pizzas would be delivered in 30min. or less or your pizza was FREE.

All the delivery drivers kept getting in car accidents to get your pizza to you on time, so it wouldn’t come out of their paycheck. It was a short-lived venture.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153657.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Brazil in the 1980s (I think) had a massive debt problem, which they tried to solve by simply printing a bunch more money.

Any economist worth their salt would have told Brazil that would cause massive inflation, and thats exactly what happened. People found their life savings were barely enough to buy groceries for a week.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153658.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. My city has issues with loud bikes/vehicles. So as a deterrent, the city put up decibel meters that displayed how loud your engine is(similar to those signs that read your speed and display it to you) but instead of deterring anyone, people would pull up to these signs and rev the heck out of their engines to see who could get the highest decibel count. The city took the counters down within a week.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153659.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. During prohibition, the US Government decided to add poison to industrial alcohol as a deterrent to people drinking it since booze was illegal. Except they didn’t tell anyone that they were doing it... so the public had no idea there was poison in the alcohol. AT LEAST 10,000 people passed away.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153660.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. I worked at Macy’s one Christmas and found out the reason why you can never find anyone at the registers is that they don’t allow employees to stand at the register because it’s “intimidating.” I can’t tell you how many times I gave up trying to purchase something there because I couldn’t find anyone to ring me up.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153661.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Washington State made it mandatory for schools to drop their room temperatures to save on electricity. The result: teachers brought their own heaters into their offices and the use of electricity increased.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153662.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Dry Counties were meant to reduce the use of alcohol in certain areas, but they result in people who want to get drunk driving further away from home to do so, increasing the odds and frequency of drunk driving accidents. Also, many attempts to rescind dry county laws end up getting countered by campaigns paid for by the bars and liquor stores that are set up on the edge of dry counties, typically under the guise of religious messages.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153663.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. Worked for a warehouse four days a week. 11am-930pm Monday to Thursday. They reiterated many times during the interview process that overtime was optional. My first day my supervisor told me that overtime is indeed optional, but if you dont stay for overtime then everybody else has to stay even later. So if you do leave on time, dont come back.

Eh whatever. I didnt mind the extra hours too much (although a 10.5 hour shift is already long) but the bonus was that we could go early if all the orders were done. As you can imagine, the good workers busted their a** from start to finish cutting as many corners (good and bad ones) as they could in order to get out early. Normally this ended up with us being able to leave around 15 mins early or on a really good day where the stars aligned (re:everybody showed up), we could leave as early as 7:30 or 8. However.. leaving that early only happened once or twice a year at most.

Overtime was every week. Every single Monday we would work until 2am. 11am-2am isnt ideal when you have no idea when youre off. At around 7pm wed start to get an idea if were in for another hour or another 6. One of the genius new hires mentioned to the boss in the office how he was hoping to get out by 6. Oh good. Apparently the boss was thinking us leaving early was a common occurance now and decided that nobody was going to be leaving early any more. Sweep or dust or whatever, but nobody leaves until 9:30.

All of a sudden we were late every single day without fail. Why? We were working our asses off to get out early but failing every day and ending up on time (or still late). By taking away our ability to leave early, everybody gave up working hard. Slow down! Weve got another hour left anyways. Im not sweeping.. Went from about 45 hours a week to 55. 13 hours every day. Nobody ever left early anymore... but nobody left on time either. Losses for everybody involved because the boss didnt realize that us leaving early for 2 days out of a year actually gave us the daily motivation to work our asses off the other 360~.

tl;dr Boss put a stop to leaving early. No incentive to work our asses off anymore means paying overtime every day.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153664.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. The infamous housing project Pruitt-Igoe had a policy of supplying housing to single mothers. However, if they stopped being single they would lose their tenancy to their homes. This meant that fathers or step-fathers of children in these poor homes had to stay away. Pruitt Igoe is a legendary social disaster and it was demolished after twenty years.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153665.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. At one point in history, the president of Paraguay tried to eliminate racism by making it illegal to marry someone within your own ethnic group.

Needless to say, this was quite racist.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153666.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. You have to eat whatever you touch was a rule in my kindergarten which led to all the children touching all the food to call dibs on it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153667.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. A Buddy of mine told me about a Happy Hour promotion a bar ran close to his campus. Apparently the special was something stupid like 50-cent beers that lasted until the first person went to the bathroom.

As he tells it, the first few weeks went without incident, but once it got more popular, people were going to extreme lengths to not be that guy including wearing adult diapers. Once people tried to covertly pee in corners and trash cans, the bar cancelled the promotion.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153668.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. I worked somewhere with a clean desk policy on Friday afternoons. The common way around this was that everyone would just sweep all their paperwork into an envelope, stick it in the internal mail, and then it would arrive back on your desk on Monday morning.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153669.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. My institute banned p**n sites from its WiFi. Most people werent tech-savvy enough or bold enough to ask how to bypass it. Then the institute banned Facebook. Everyone learned to use proxy in a matter of days.

Lets just say the servers were under heavy pressure from then onwards.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153671.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. In Kenya, our governor in Nairobi banned public transport from getting to town so people had to walk long distances to work. And since we don’t have enough pavements, people ended up walking on the roads (like 3000) and there was a traffic jam that lasted for more than 5hrs. The next day the ban was removed.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153672.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. When I worked for immigration, some bright spark decided that we werent going to remove people who had been caught smuggling drugs from certain countries. They believed it was too risky to deport people, who had failed to complete their jobs, back to pissed off gangs.

News traveled quickly and within a few weeks, there was a huge spike in smuggling. People were smuggling drugs and immediately handing themselves over to authorities to guarantee that they wouldnt get deported. In addition, dealers found it much easier to convince people to attempt to smuggle drugs because it was a win-win for all parties. The whole idea was scrapped pretty quickly.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153675.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. No cards game at school

When I was in elementary/middle school Magic The Gathering and the Pokemon card game were pretty popular. Almost all of the guys played and would get together after lunch to play before classes started again.

Here is where its important for me to mention that this was a Christian school. It probably didnt take long for a teacher, administrator, or helicopter parent to wonder what all the fuss was about. Sure enough, one of them probably got a hold of an MTG card, saw art depicting a demon, and decided that this had to be the work of Satan to warp our young minds.

Almost over night, all trading card games were banned from school. Any cards would be confiscated until the end of the school year.

Well, you now have several dozen pre-pubescent boys with about 30 minutes of free time and nothing to do. So we did boy s**t. Ran around, pushed each other, went places we werent supposed to, just overall got into mischief. All this time they had a free babysitter that was keeping us all engaged, quiet, and civil, all while reinforcing quick math skills and teaching multi-level problem-solving.

The next year we got a new administrator and card games were allowed at school again.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153676.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">31. The school I go to has a rule that says if you come late 3 times, you get an unjustified absence, which lowers your grade quite a bit. So if someone is late they pretty much always skip class so they can get an absence that can be justified by simply signing it...</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153677.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">32. At my old job, some people abused lunch so they made a few of em text in when they started and finished lunch. One guy specifically would text the start time, a place he got food, his order in detail, the address, price, etc. Even when he bought a snack while out. That stopped a week later.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87153678.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

## <a href="#linky17" id="linky16">25 Terrifying Things Ex-cons Saw in Prison</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Not me, but I spoke to a former inmate after his release who had developed severe PTSD from some of the things he witnessed while incarcerated. One of the stories was that he was playing cards with some guys and one of them was smoking a cigarette. Another inmate who was not playing with them approached the table and asked the guy smoking if he could get “shorts” on the cigarette (shorts means before you finished smoking, you gave the cigarette to someone else so they got the last few puffs before putting it out.)

<span style="font-size:4em">
The smoker agreed, the inmate wandered off and they went back to playing cards. Well, the guy playing cards must have forgot and finished the cigarette. A little while later the other inmate came back to the table asking for the short, and the guy at the table told him that he had forgotten about it and finished the cigarette. Guy wanders off again and they go back to playing cards. Shortly afterward, the inmate who wanted shorts comes back to the table, comes up behind the player, pulls his head back, and started shanking him in the eye and throat with a pen/pencil. Dude died over forgetting to give someone a damn cigarette butt. -u/GeiCobra</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153148.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. My brother said a guy across from him had a new cellmate who had gastrointestinal problems and wouldnt stop farting these rancid horrible farts after the guy told him repeatedly to stop (not like he could help it.) So the guy beat the farter to death in their cell with his bare hands. My brother said he had never seen so much blood from one person before. -u/I_Only_Eat_Tacos</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153150.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. I got stabbed with a Dixon pencil, but that was from Richard Busby. Mr ‘Tie my boss up and burn him alive.’ It was over a gambling debt he owed me, he’s old and weak, I ultimately took twice what he owed me, and we were back at the table playing poker together that same day.

Google his name if you’d like. I believe he just had an appeal denied or some sh*t.
Either you become one of them, or you live underneath them. And once you’re one of them, they’re surprisingly and frighteningly good-natured and decent. -u/MyExesStalkMyReddit</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153153.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. I did a 4-month stint in Kajang (Malaysia). This Nigerian dude used to pilfer from other cells. This Malay gang found him and dipped his hand in boiling oil (basically deep fried it while it was still attached to him). That scream, it still curdles my blood. Poor guy was reduced to an unconscious pool of blood, sweat, tears, vomit, sh*t, and piss. He lost more than his hand on that day. -u/DeusExKFC</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153154.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Was playing Scrabble waiting on the phone to open up. A dude was on the phone with his wife and kids and started losing his sh*t all of a sudden. He started yelling in the most guttural heartbreaking way NO NO NO NOOOO!! The guards were like HEY CALM DOWN NOW! While he was on the phone with them someone did a drive-by on his house and shot his wife and killed one of his children.

The guards snatched the phone from him and threw him on the ground, restrained him, and took him where there are no phones. Guy was weeping saying he just heard his baby get killed on the phone.

<span style="font-size:4em">7. A guy got stomped to death my first day in. The 2 guys fighting were rival gang members. The guards didnt do anything until the guy getting stomped stopped breathing. Then they came in and took them both away. One in a bag and one in cuffs. -u/fosnin</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153158.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Dude in the cell next to mine tried to kill himself with a sharpened pencil. He just kept stabbing himself in the chest but couldn’t get deep enough.

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Brixton, A Wing. Coming back from the canteen, this scary-looking, wild-eyed dude steps across and tells me to hand over my burn/tobacco. I laugh and say no and walk by, waiting for him to do something. Nothing happened. Few minutes later, the same guy opened some poor lads stomach with one slash and he was lying there trying to hold his intestines in, I saw the fear and panic on his face. The scary guy just casually walked away. No idea what happened to either of them. Alarms went off. Everyone back to their cells and locked up again. -u/Bully2533</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153160.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Boiling hot peanut butter dumped on a sleeping child molesters face …. The screaming and thrashing were pretty intense…. The idea is that you can’t wipe it off or something to mitigate the damage caused, it’s going to burn deeply. And in my opinion, that was worse than watching a guy on the bench press take a 35k plate smash to the skull repeatedly…. He was dead pretty quickly… the peanut butter burn is a permanent disfigurement that will have months of pain and suffering. -u/WB-butinagoodway</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153161.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. I was never in prison, but in jail a bit for drug charges. I was in my 30s, but my bunky was a really nice 19-year-old kid in there for selling drugs. He seemed a bit over his head, but introduced me to the jits (I didn’t know anyone) and we’d play cards and sh*t. He had a real high bond, and one day they said to get his sh*t he got bail.

He didn’t know who, but I was so happy for him. The next morning the CO told me he was shot and killed that night (Being very respectful, everyone liked the guy). It was confirmed on the evening news. Really f*cked me up, and I can guess who got him bailed. -u/JoseZiggler</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153164.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. I saw someone take a hotpot fill it up with baby oil add a pound of sugar, add some magic shave, bring it to a boil then splash it in a persons face...It literally melted the guys face off. This happened around 1999 and I still have the occasional nightmare about it. -u/XconJon1978</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153165.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Just the way that some people talk about murder. Some of the people in there would be telling a story, casually drop the fact that they killed someone, then keep going on with the story like nothing happened. -u/DrinkJazzlike3487</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153166.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Not a crazy story but was in for a few days and didnt realize they put you in cells based on the color of your skin. Im a white dude with a Hispanic last name and they put me in a cell with a straight Nazi who told me if I went to actual prison (I was only in for a weekend) I would be a misfit because I wasnt one thing or the other. He openly called the black dudes next to our cell horrible things. -u/undego1423</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153167.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Two guys in the kitchen made a bet that one of them wouldn’t go through the commercial dishwasher. Guy took the bet and went through...Came out the other side as one human-sized blister, 100% of his skin was blistered full of juice. He was airlifted out in a bubble-wrapped suit to hospital. I was fresh in at the time and working in the kitchen when this happened. But I wasn’t in the dish room. The blood-curdling screaming as the dishwasher cycled on still gives me goosebumps 10 years later. And I can’t un-see what a human covered in blisters looks like. I don’t know if he survived as they don’t give updates to inmates. I do know the guy who bet him was charged with fresh street charges. -u/Giveyourapplesthanks</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153168.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. I’m not a con but my dad told me when he was upstream, guards informed them that they had a high case child rapist coming in. When the guy got there he ended up being this old white man walking with a cane. He didn’t last very long on the courtyard. (They killed him on the prison yard.) -u/Infamous-Reyug</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87153169.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Had a guy stick a full-size #2 pencil in his leg, the long way (inserted into his thigh, and shoved it under the skin until you couldn’t see it anymore). Took him to the hospital to have it removed. Days later, he did the same thing, in the same hole with a rubberized pencil. Rinse and repeat, hospital removes the pencil again.
