<span style="font-size:4em">3. “That bulls get angered by the colour red- they are colour blind so it really makes no difference.

<span style="font-size:4em">6. “That MSG is bad for you. Its literally a naturally occurring amino acid in certain green plant life that utilized photosynthesis, with normal salt used as a binding agent. The myth came from a single person writing to a newspaper back in the 70s (I believe) where he ended up with a headache after visiting a Chinese restaurant, and the only ingredient in the dish he had that he didnt recognize was monosodium glutamate, and because people are stupid and it sounds scary, he blamed it on that.

<span style="font-size:4em">
And it led to a bunch of people reporting similar anecdotal stories that led to the myth of it being bad for you. There have been dozens of studies confirming that its perfectly safe and doesnt cause headaches or any other known ailments.” -Tonsai</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174556.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. “People on the internet really seem to buy into the idea that elephants find humans cute. The source of this is a tumblr post that claims the same region of the brain thats active when humans see puppies is what lights up when elephants see us. But that requires MRI machines big enough to accommodate elephants, as well as keeping an animal that weighs like 5 tons still whilst its fully conscious. It also means assuming that the brain structures do the same job across species.

<span style="font-size:4em">
If anything, the harsh reality is that wild elephants probably see humans as threats, given that as a species were actively doing our best to kill them. Elephants who live in zoos or sanctuaries may be endeared to their keepers and thus humans in general, however. The good news is that this can probably change if poaching is ever stopped. Elephants whod been raised in the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, for example, have led sick or injured herd-mates back to the sanctuary for treatment.” -ButterflyOfDeath</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174571.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. “That humans will eventually evolve to lose the little toe as we dont use it. No, thats not how evolution works. Unless at some point in the future not having one increases our chances of reproducing, the little toe is not going anywhere. Also regarding evolution, we didnt exactly evolve from monkeys, its more like monkeys and us share a common ancestor, but then we split into different evolution branches.” -Dr_Chemiramen</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87174573.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Twenty or more US Airmen were in Hiroshima as POWs when the Atom Bomb fell. SSG Ralph J.

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Moved to a neighborhood not to long ago, and the first person I meet was an older woman in her 50s. She told me all about her drug use and how sometimes she ends up outside naked and asked if I would help her back inside and put clothes on her. This was all in 5 minutes of saying hello. -Horribleheadaches</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167809.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Visited a coffee shop for the first time on holiday. Barista commented on my tattoos. I said thank you. She told me shes not allowed to get tattoos but she cuts herself to enjoy the pain and thats nearly the same thing. I found a different coffee shop for the rest of the holiday. -kyridwen

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Chatted with a huge middle-aged dude in a bar once who after about 2 minutes, told me that he had been in prison for bashing his dads head in with a hammer. His dad used to beat his mom and one day hed had enough of it. -RVT223</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167801.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Temporary coworker tells me she was kidnapped, raped and beaten by her ex husband. Burned with cigarettes, hands shoved in the garbage disposal, head beaten with a hammer. The incident resulted in a baby she somehow still has. And they’re not even divorced because he won’t sign the divorce papers. I work in a small town gas station, I’m trying to check out customers and she’s reciting a true crime episode to me. The conversation started with mascara recommendations. It was the craziest thing I’ve ever heard -whydidithavetobeme-</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167802.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Stuck driving a coworker out to a remote gas plant to do a system install. He was kinda f**ked up but assumed it was just socially awkward IT way. Nope. He starts telling me about him and his dad collecting nazi memorabilia and how proud he was of his German grandparents. Trying to make other small talk and he would just trail off answering questions and start singing to himself. Thought for sure I’d end up on the news and a manhunt would be conducted. -Dice_to_see_you</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167803.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Second best story - met the neighbour right after we moved in and she started telling me about them wanting another kid but doing the deed was hard because she was overweight, and had bad knees and it just made it difficult. I’m a guy who never met her and have my kids playing mere feet away so I can’t call her batshit crazy. -Dice_to_see_you</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167804.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Oh, I have another one. Girl I worked with but didnt really know beyond her name.

<span style="font-size:4em">8. A customer explained to me the benefits of a coffee enema to heal everything from my acne to preventing cancer. I couldnt get her to leave me alone for an hour because it was dead and no one was there to help. I worked for a skincare counter in a department store.

<span style="font-size:4em">
Like if you dont need my products because cleaning your a** with coffee fixes it, why are you here? But she went on about how she started her kids on these and did their enemas until they could do theirs on their own. What. Then she also grabbed my hands and kept saying promise me youll try it. Promise me. She left after I promised. No, I didnt try it. -TenaciousToffee</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167807.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. A guy told me during our first shift that his youngest daughter was suicidal, his eldest daughters boyfriend was terribly abusive, and his wife was sleeping with someone at her work. Apparently he’d just gotten out of jail after flying home from out of state, beating the sh*t out of his daughters boyfriend, his brothers, and his dad, driving to his wife’s work and beating the sh*t out of her boyfriend.

<span style="font-size:4em">10. Had to get my picture taken for a visa so went to a local photography shop that took the pictures and printed them out for you right there. I had been talking to the guy as he worked on other peoples photos and when I finally got my picture taken he started opening up about his family.
Apparently his son was killed 3 years ago in a car accident and he was telling me how much I reminded him of his son (going to school for engineering, 1st generation college student etc.) The son was killed in his senior year so didnt even get to graduate, he even showed me pictures it was heartbreaking.

<span style="font-size:4em">
To make things worse he said he had a degenerative muscular disease and doctors had given him about 2-3 years before hed be bed ridden. He then went on to say his daughter was taking care of him and how she isnt married yet and deserves to live a young persons life and man, it really put into perspective how bad some people have it. I still think about that guy to this day and hope hes doing well. -EA721</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167814.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. Sat on an Amtrak across from a very sweet older man, who within twenty minutes was telling me about the purpose of his trip to Maryland: to meet his biological father, who he had discovered via 23andMe, to discuss changing his last name, which was the condition of becoming being the sole inheritor of his father’s estate. And that he was feeling a little guilty about that because his three half sisters would be excluded from their father’s will because he “finally had a legacy.” Woof. He disembarked twenty minutes later, and I have thought about it constantly for the following four years. -mom_jean</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167816.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Hitchhiking through New Zealand, I got picked up by a semi driver. Awesome guy, but an hour into the drive started unloading every bit of personal information he could. How he’s cheated on his wife, screwed the company out of money, stolen items… It was like I was a priest in a confession booth. When I asked him why he told me all of that, he said it’s been eating him up inside for years and telling me helped get it off of his chest. He said I had no idea who he or anyone he knew was, so it felt like I was the perfect person to unload on. -birdizthawerd</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167819.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Used to work at a ski resort and was working in a different area than I normally work. Well this lady who I was working with found out I was slightly acquainted with her fiance and proceeded to tell me all about how his family hates her and is mean to her and all about his substance abuse issues. I dont remember all the details because it was a few years ago but she unloaded on me with every issue of her relationship and Im like Im just here to work. I didnt really even know her fiance. I avoided that lady after that. -beau8888</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167821.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. My favorite ever was some stranger outside a bar. Seemed normal enough until she said My husband and I used to do meth, but we dont anymore. I applauded her on this and then she followed up with Yeah, now we only have meth weekends. -FaintCommand</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87167823.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. New roommate told me her current boyfriend got kicked out of college for sexual assault and was under investigation for another case of sexual assault.

They always say she should be more loving of her body and embrace her body hair.It’s annoying. She does it cause SHE likes it. She goes to the gym and does deadlifts cause it empowers her and makes her feel AMAZING. Like, we all have different ideals and visions for our life.

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Believing that its a mans job to impress her when shes dating. F*ck that, if you like someone ACT AS THOUGH YOU LIKE THEM.

## <a href="#linky14" id="linky13">30 Unfortunate Names Parents Gave to Children</a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. Ohnasti.

Supposedly pronounced “Honesty” but all I’ll ever see is “Oh Nasty!”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177387.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. One little girl got her name legally changed in court, because her parents named her Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177382.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. Abcde (pronounced Ab-city).</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177383.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Any name based on a popular TV series or movie. Like, if I see your daughter is named Khaleesi, I think significantly less of you as a person.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177384.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. Not so much a specific name, but gross butcherings of names. Ie. Kaightlynne instead of Caitlyn.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177385.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. Renesmee</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177386.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. I was once checking in a customer for service.

EmoChanel

And she was very proud of it.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177388.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. I was on a little league baseball team with these two brothers named Doer and Achiever.

Talk about pressure to perform, those parents had expectations.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177389.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. So my Wife was giving birth to our first Son and the midwife asked if we’d chosen a name yet. We said yes and told her ‘Seth’. She replied “Oh thank goodness, a normal name! The last woman in here named her child Precious Bunny!”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177390.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. I used to write on cakes, the worst name I ever saw was Tuba Poo. I asked if it was a nickname, it was not. Its been like 6 years and it still haunts me. Her mothers name was Natalie, why Natalie? Why?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177391.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">11. A co-worker has a friend who named her daughters Vengeance and Violence.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177392.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">12. The overly matchy names to the point of ridiculousness. My top example is a set of brothers named Romance, Romantic, and Romeo.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177393.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">13. Back when I worked with children, I met a young lass named Younique. I felt sorry for her. She was only 4-5 at the time, and the moment she entered school, she began to hate it because the other children thought that it was silly and wouldn’t play with her. Eventually, the dad of another child said that it was a bad name *to her face.* Seriously. Don’t do things like this to your children. They aren’t pets. They’ll have to deal with the repercussions of your bad naming choices.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177381.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">14. Someone I know is a nurse in the ER so theyve delivered quite a few babies. But one day they said that one set of parents decided to name their kid Ssss. You pronounce Ssss, Forest.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177394.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">15. Baby. As in the Dirty Dancing lead female. Because nobody in the professional world is going to want their name to be Baby.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177395.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">16. Kash. It isnt the worst name in the world but the fact his second name was Ransom, made it a whole lot worse.

Kash Ransom.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177396.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">17. Saw a fun name on the attendance sheet (so this is official) of one of my classes: Daddyboi</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177397.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">18. MyLuv (yes, I have met a kid named this). That poor kid is probably not going to be successful, unless they change their name later on.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177398.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">19. I went to high school with a one Crystal Shanda Lear.

This was back before dumb names were the rage. She would have been named that in, say, 81-82. Poor girl. I dont know that I lost respect for the parents so much as felt bad for her to be saddled with that s**t.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177399.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">20. I lose respect for parents who give their kids first names that when added to their given last names become horrible. The parents dont even care that their kid has to live with it. Two real examples Ive come across are Richard Sieman (The guys name is D**k Semen, for f***s sake.) And even worse, Desire Cox.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177400.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">21. Anaesthasia. No s**t. Her name on her school documents was Anaesthasia.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177401.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">22. One of my former employees had the first name “Baby Destiny.” Yes. Really.

Worse still, HR just put “Baby” on her name badge. For every time I had to catch myself and say the full name so I didn’t sound like a creep, I can only imagine how many other people didn’t realize there were two words in her name and had to refer to her as just Baby. Or how she must have felt to have EVERYONE calling her Baby.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177402.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">23. Royalty. Legit worked with this hood dude named royalty. I think it kinda speaks for itself.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177403.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">24. You know the Duggar family (19 Kids and Counting)? One of their daughters named their son Spurgeon. SPURGEON.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177404.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">25. I knew three sisters names -Autumn-Breeze, Summer-Skye and April-Rain.

Bonus addition one of them had a kid and named it Gidget.

Edit for those wondering: This is in Eastern Canada.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177405.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">26. One time when I was working at a motel, I took a reservation over the phone from a woman for her daughter:

Woman: Her name is Sri Lanka, S R I space L A N K A...

Me: Oh, you mean like the country!

Woman: Whaddaya mean, country?!?</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177406.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">27. There is a kid at my school literally named Shadow Black.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177407.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">28. Tequila, but pronounced tuh-quill-uh</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177408.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">29. Strap in and prepare for rough seas!

My mom is a midwife and one day she came home with what she thought was the epitome of dumb names.

These parents had just gotten back from a trip to the states, where they had visited a dock to look at boats, and one of those beautiful boats had an even more beautiful and exotic name, they wanted to name their baby daughter after this boat.

My mom is a saint for not laughing.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177409.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">30. Prancer and Vixen for babies born during the Christmas season.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87177410.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
