<span style="font-size:4em">3. “Theres this guy called General Dyer. Hes probably the most hated guy in India. Heres the story: Britan has imposed rowlatt act in india. This act made protests and debates among indians illegal. And also gave the cops right to arrest poltical prisoners without trail for 2 years. Ofcourse people were angry. On 13 April 1919 people gathered up at Jallianwala Bagh. The people here consisted of protestors, residents and people who came to pray in a temple that exists in this area. When dyer was said about this he ordered to close all the gates of this place and shoot the people.

## <a href="#linky3" id="linky2">12 Common Myths People Falsely Believe Are True </a><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">1. There is no gravity in space. Actually, gravity is everywhere. It shapes the orbits of the planets, the solar system, and even the galaxies. It is true that gravity decreases with distance. So the further you are away from a planet or star the less gravity you feel. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135679.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">

Gravity is pulling us down, so every ship in the orbit around the Earth is slowly falling toward our planet. And since the ship and our astronauts are falling at the same speed and the latter have nothing to press against, they feel so weightless.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135680.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">2. Lightning never strikes the same place twice. That’s a nice proverb, but a little bit far from reality. Of course, repeated lightning strikes have a very low probability, but they are not impossible. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135681.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em"> 

Take for instance the Empire State Building which is struck by lightning about 20-25 times each year. The building was once struck 8 times in 24 minutes, so being hit several times within a short time span isn’t that unusual after all.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135682.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">3. All dinosaurs went extinct after an asteroid hit the Earth. Sometimes it seems like we learned this in school. In reality, though, the asteroid killed about 75 percent of all plants and animal life on the planet, some small species of dinosaurs survived and evolved into birds. This fact is supported by fossils dated after the so-called K-T event. Yet the extinction also provided evolutionary opportunities. Before the event, mammals tended to become dinosaurs’ meals. After that mammals, at last, got a chance to evolve into larger and more complex species, like horses, whales, bats, and primates.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135683.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">4. Doing crunches will give you a flat stomach. Unfortunately, we cannot target fat loss in our bodies. We can only build more muscle. So doing crunches alone won’t give you a flat super-impressive stomach with that ever-elusive 6-pack. If you don’t eat healthily and don’t do cardiovascular or full-body training in addition to that, you’ll just build lots of muscle under your belly fat and it may seem even bigger than before.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135684.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">5. The 5-second rule.  It is still believed that if you drop some food on the ground and pick it up within 5 seconds, it is safe to eat it without rewashing. Some people extend that to 10 seconds, some think it helps them to develop a robust immune system, others simply don’t care much about it. But either way, there are too many germs on the floor and if something lands on them they immediately stick to it, no matter whether it is food or not.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135685.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">6. There’s a dye in pool water that detects urine. This “scary” myth came right from our childhood. And really there’s no better “remedy” in this case than making kids believe they can be caught peeing by some super-cool ingredient that they add to pool water. While in reality there is no such thing as a urine-detecting dye even though there are many warning signs that the pool is monitored with a chemical “pee alert.”</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135686.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">7. Touching a toad will give you warts. This myth probably originates from the fact that toads have many wart-like bumps on their skin. In reality, those are just glands and toads don’t secrete anything that can cause warts on our skin. As dermatologists say, actual warts are only caused by human viruses. Though the toads’ glands may contain poison that really irritates the skin.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135687.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">8. Penguins fall backward when they look up at airplanes. Legend says that British pilots were buzzing around the islands off the coast of South America and they saw penguins toppling over like dominoes when the birds looked skyward. Well, scientists tested this story and found out that these amazingly awkward creatures can maintain their footing perfectly, even while looking upward. Though low-flying aircraft can really cause them to panic and leave their nests.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135688.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">9. Opossums hang by their tails. This myth has also appeared in some popular movies. And like many others, this myth is also totally illogical and absurd. Sure opossums can grasp branches with their tails while climbing trees and babies can hang by their tails for a little while. But adult opossums are too heavy to do that for more than just a few seconds. Besides, it is completely useless because would inhibit their survival. All in all, they simply have no reason to do this.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135689.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

<span style="font-size:4em">10. If you touch a baby bird with your bare hands, its mother will reject it. It is common among parents to not allow their children to touch any nests or the baby birds inside them. Also, it is believed that even if you pick up a lost baby bird and return it to its nest, its mother will reject it because of the human smell on its dear baby. In reality, most wild animals have a very strong bond with their babies and they won’t abandon them no matter what.</span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87135690.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>

The Germans were using this area as a rallying point to stage a fighting withdrawal back to Italy, but the Brazilians killed or captured them all instead - within three days they’d killed 500, captured 15,000 (including two Generals) and taken 1500 vehicles and 80 guns. The idea of a fighting withdrawal was perhaps slightly fanciful, and the town held little strategic value, but nevertheless, the battle contributed to the remainder of the German Army in Italy surrendering just four days later. </span><br><img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87134626.jpg" style="width:100%"><br>
